"<p>Yesterday I found an <a href=""http://kynosarges.org/StructPerformance.html"">article by Christoph Nahr titled "".NET Struct Performance""</a>  which benchmarked several languages (C++, C#, Java, JavaScript) for a method which adds two point structs (<code>double</code> tuples).</p>

<p>As it turned out, C++ version takes about 1000ms to execute (1e9 iterations), while C# cannot get under ~3000ms on the same machine (and performs even worse in x64).</p>

<p>To test it myself, I took the C# code (and simplified slightly to call only the method where parameters are passed by value), and ran it on a i7-3610QM machine (3.1Ghz boost for single core), 8GB RAM, Win8.1, using .NET 4.5.2, RELEASE build 32-bit (x86 WoW64 since my OS is 64-bit). This is the simplified version:</p>

<pre><code>public static class CSharpTest
{
    private const int ITERATIONS = 1000000000;

    [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining)]
    private static Point AddByVal(Point a, Point b)
    {
        return new Point(a.X + b.Y, a.Y + b.X);
    }

    public static void Main()
    {
        Point a = new Point(1, 1), b = new Point(1, 1);

        Stopwatch sw = Stopwatch.StartNew();
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; ITERATIONS; i++)
            a = AddByVal(a, b);
        sw.Stop();

        Console.WriteLine(""Result: x={0} y={1}, Time elapsed: {2} ms"", 
            a.X, a.Y, sw.ElapsedMilliseconds);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>With <code>Point</code> defined as simply:</p>

<pre><code>public struct Point 
{
    private readonly double _x, _y;

    public Point(double x, double y) { _x = x; _y = y; }

    public double X { get { return _x; } }

    public double Y { get { return _y; } }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Running it produces the results similar to those in the article:</p>

<pre><code>Result: x=1000000001 y=1000000001, Time elapsed: 3159 ms
</code></pre>

<p><strong>First strange observation</strong></p>

<p>Since the method should be inlined, I wondered how the code would perform if I removed structs altogether and simply inlined the whole thing together:</p>

<pre><code>public static class CSharpTest
{
    private const int ITERATIONS = 1000000000;

    public static void Main()
    {
        // not using structs at all here
        double ax = 1, ay = 1, bx = 1, by = 1;

        Stopwatch sw = Stopwatch.StartNew();
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; ITERATIONS; i++)
        {
            ax = ax + by;
            ay = ay + bx;
        }
        sw.Stop();

        Console.WriteLine(""Result: x={0} y={1}, Time elapsed: {2} ms"", 
            ax, ay, sw.ElapsedMilliseconds);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And got practically the same result (actually 1% slower after several retries), meaning that JIT-ter seems to be doing a good job optimizing all function calls:</p>

<pre><code>Result: x=1000000001 y=1000000001, Time elapsed: 3200 ms
</code></pre>

<p>It also means that the benchmark doesn't seem to measure any <code>struct</code> performance and actually only seem to measure basic <code>double</code> arithmetic (after everything else gets optimized away).</p>

<p><strong>The weird stuff</strong></p>

<p>Now comes the weird part. If I merely add <strong>another stopwatch outside the loop</strong> (yes, I narrowed it down to this crazy step after several retries), the code runs <strong>three times faster</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>public static void Main()
{
    var outerSw = Stopwatch.StartNew();     // &lt;-- added

    {
        Point a = new Point(1, 1), b = new Point(1, 1);

        var sw = Stopwatch.StartNew();
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; ITERATIONS; i++)
            a = AddByVal(a, b);
        sw.Stop();

        Console.WriteLine(""Result: x={0} y={1}, Time elapsed: {2} ms"",
            a.X, a.Y, sw.ElapsedMilliseconds);
    }

    outerSw.Stop();                         // &lt;-- added
}

Result: x=1000000001 y=1000000001, Time elapsed: 961 ms
</code></pre>

<p>That's ridiculous! And it's not like <code>Stopwatch</code> is giving me wrong results because I can clearly see that it ends after a single second.</p>

<p><strong>Can anyone tell me what might be happening here?</strong></p>

<p><strong>(Update)</strong></p>

<p>I also presumed it has something to do with JITting, but repeating the test several times (without the outer stopwatch) is slow in all cases:</p>

<pre><code>public static class CSharpTest
{
    private const int ITERATIONS = 1000000000;

    [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining)]
    private static Point AddByVal(Point a, Point b)
    {
        return new Point(a.X + b.Y, a.Y + b.X);
    }

    public static void Main()
    {
        Test();
        Test();
        Test();
    }

    private static void Test()
    {
        Point a = new Point(1, 1), b = new Point(1, 1);

        var sw = Stopwatch.StartNew();
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; ITERATIONS; i++)
            a = AddByVal(a, b);
        sw.Stop();

        Console.WriteLine(""Result: x={0} y={1}, Time elapsed: {2} ms"", 
           a.X, a.Y, sw.ElapsedMilliseconds);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>Result: x=1000000001 y=1000000001, Time elapsed: 3251 ms
Result: x=1000000001 y=1000000001, Time elapsed: 3249 ms
Result: x=1000000001 y=1000000001, Time elapsed: 3250 ms
</code></pre>

<p>Again, with the outer stopwatch added, we get the magical boost:</p>

<pre><code>    public static void Main()
    {
        Test();
        Test();
        Test();
    }

    private static void Test()
    {
        var outerSw = Stopwatch.StartNew();

        Point a = new Point(1, 1), b = new Point(1, 1);

        var sw = Stopwatch.StartNew();
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; ITERATIONS; i++)
            a = AddByVal(a, b);
        sw.Stop();

        Console.WriteLine(""Result: x={0} y={1}, Time elapsed: {2} ms"", a.X, a.Y, sw.ElapsedMilliseconds);

        outerSw.Stop();
    }

Result: x=1000000001 y=1000000001, Time elapsed: 979 ms
Result: x=1000000001 y=1000000001, Time elapsed: 982 ms
Result: x=1000000001 y=1000000001, Time elapsed: 978 ms
</code></pre>

<p><strong>(Update 2)</strong></p>

<p>Here are two methods in the same program, which shows that the reason is not JITting:</p>

<pre><code>public static class CSharpTest
{
    private const int ITERATIONS = 1000000000;

    [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining)]
    private static Point AddByVal(Point a, Point b)
    {
        return new Point(a.X + b.Y, a.Y + b.X);
    }

    public static void Main()
    {
        Test1();
        Test2();

        Console.WriteLine();

        Test1();
        Test2();
    }

    private static void Test1()
    {
        Point a = new Point(1, 1), b = new Point(1, 1);

        var sw = Stopwatch.StartNew();
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; ITERATIONS; i++)
            a = AddByVal(a, b);
        sw.Stop();

        Console.WriteLine(""Test1: x={0} y={1}, Time elapsed: {2} ms"", 
            a.X, a.Y, sw.ElapsedMilliseconds);
    }

    private static void Test2()
    {
        var swOuter = Stopwatch.StartNew();

        Point a = new Point(1, 1), b = new Point(1, 1);

        var sw = Stopwatch.StartNew();
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; ITERATIONS; i++)
            a = AddByVal(a, b);
        sw.Stop();

        Console.WriteLine(""Test2: x={0} y={1}, Time elapsed: {2} ms"", 
            a.X, a.Y, sw.ElapsedMilliseconds);

        swOuter.Stop();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>Test1: x=1000000001 y=1000000001, Time elapsed: 3242 ms
Test2: x=1000000001 y=1000000001, Time elapsed: 974 ms

<p><strong>(Update 3)</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://pastebin.com/9RykzS6g"">Here is a pastebin.</a> You need to run it as a 32-bit release on .NET 4.x (there are a couple of checks in the code to ensure this).</p>

<p><strong>(Solution, perhaps?)</strong> (read <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/32117038/69809"">@HansPassant's answer</a> for details)</p>

<p>According to @Hans, the slowdown is happening due to 64-bit variables not always being aligned in 32-bit apps. If I add a 32-bit variable to one of the test methods, it will perform as fast as the C++ version:</p>

<pre><code>private static void Test3()
{
    var magical_speed_booster = ""whatever"";

    {
        Point a = new Point(1, 1), b = new Point(1, 1);

        var sw = Stopwatch.StartNew();
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; ITERATIONS; i++)
            a = AddByVal(a, b);
        sw.Stop();

        Console.WriteLine(""Test2: x={0} y={1}, Time elapsed: {2} ms"",
            a.X, a.Y, sw.ElapsedMilliseconds);
    }

    GC.KeepAlive(magical_speed_booster);
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>(Update 4)</strong></p>

<p>Following @usr's comments on @Hans' answer, I checked the optimized disassembly for both methods, and they are rather different:</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Bg3Fc.png""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Bg3Fc.png"" alt=""Test1 on the left, Test2 on the right""></a></p>

<p>This seems to show that the difference might be due to compiler acting funny in the first case, rather than double field alignment?</p>

<p>Also, if I add <strong>two</strong> variables (total offset of 8 bytes), I still get the same speed boost - and it no longer seems it's related to field alignment:</p>

<pre><code>// this is still fast?
private static void Test3()
{
    var magical_speed_booster_1 = ""whatever"";
    var magical_speed_booster_2 = ""whatever"";

    {
        Point a = new Point(1, 1), b = new Point(1, 1);

        var sw = Stopwatch.StartNew();
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; ITERATIONS; i++)
            a = AddByVal(a, b);
        sw.Stop();

        Console.WriteLine(""Test2: x={0} y={1}, Time elapsed: {2} ms"",
            a.X, a.Y, sw.ElapsedMilliseconds);
    }

    GC.KeepAlive(magical_speed_booster_1);
    GC.KeepAlive(magical_speed_booster_2);

I've looked into <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24538501/what-are-differences-between-rgb-vs-rgba-other-than-opacity"">the formatting</a> of RGBA, and looked for similar questions (to no avail). Every question/answer that mentions the conversion from <code>transparent</code> to <code>rgba(0,0,0,0)</code> always has the words 'should' or 'according' in. (For example <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/15958610/4907552"">here</a>). What is the actual difference, and why does it change the output so much?</p>

<p><strong>N.B:</strong> This occurs in most, if not all, versions of Internet Explorer. We also know that it occurs in some versions of Firefox.  However Chrome and Safari do not display this behaviour, leading us to believe that there is some sort of patch for this in <code>-webkit</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>To be able to submit this as a bug we need to reproduce the problem using the minimal amount of code. So, transferred from my other question, here is a comparison of using <code>transparent</code> vs <code>rgba(0,0,0,0)</code>, and what happens when we use both.</p>

<h2>Transparent</h2>

<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""true"">
<div class=""snippet-code snippet-currently-hidden"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-css lang-css prettyprint-override""><code>@keyframes spin{

<pre class=""snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;div class=""spinme""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>

<h2>RGBA(0,0,0,0)</h2>

<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""true"">
<div class=""snippet-code snippet-currently-hidden"">

</p>

<h2>Both</h2>

<p>As pointed out by @andyb, there is strange behaviour when using both on separate elements. You would expect only one to wobble, however they both do. As demonstrated:</p>

<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""true"">
<div class=""snippet-code snippet-currently-hidden"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-css lang-css prettyprint-override""><code>@keyframes spin{
  0% {transform:rotateZ(0deg);}
  50% {transform:rotateZ(360deg);border-radius:60%;}
  100%{transform:rotateZ(720deg);}
}
.spinme{
  display:inline-block;
  position:relative;
  left:0;
  top:0;
  margin:0.2rem;
  width:0.8rem;
  height:0.8rem;
  border:0.2rem solid black;
  border-radius:0%;
  outline: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0);
  transform:rotateZ(0deg);
  animation: spin infinite 4s;
}
.spinme:nth-of-type(2){
  outline: 1px solid transparent;
}</code></pre>
<pre class=""snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;div class=""spinme""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=""spinme""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>

<p>For those who can't test this in Internet Explorer, here is an animated .gif of the problem:</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/5dB6B.gif"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/5dB6B.gif"" alt=""Comparison in an animated .gif""></a></p>

<p>This is with <code>transparent</code> on the left, <code>rgba</code> in the middle, and both on the right.</p>

<hr>

<p>Thanks to @juan-c-v's answer I decided to attempt to create a test to find the computed value for <code>transparent</code> in each browser, and came up with the following: </p>

<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>$('p').text($('p').css(""background-color""));</code></pre>
<pre class=""snippet-code-css lang-css prettyprint-override""><code>p{background-color:transparent;}</code></pre>
<pre class=""snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;script src=""https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>

<p>If you are viewing this in Chrome/Safari, then you will most likely see (comment if you don't) <code>rgba(0,0,0,0)</code>. However in IE, you will probably see <code>transparent</code> still. I was reading the <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh674956(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">MSDN</a> reference and found that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The transparent keyword is not supported.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which explains why the browsers display different results. However it doesn't explain anywhere what their version of <code>transparent</code> is actually defined as. I looked through the old CSS1 and CSS2 w3c specs and couldn't find an old definition. What does <code>transparent</code> mean?</p>
"
"<p>This is confusing me, i am trying to create an identifier like Jquery.</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax
$('object')
</code></pre>

<p>the jquery identifier <code>$</code> can be called without its parenthesis.</p>

<p>Here is some code i got:</p>

<pre><code>function initialized_object(){
    this.method = function(){
        console.log('this is a string');
    }
}
var o = function (args){
    if(arguments.length &gt; 0){
        //return N$(arguments[0], arguments[1]);
    }else{
        return new initialized_object();
    }
};
o.prototype.constructor.toString = function(){
    this.call(this);
}
o().method();
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Instead of <code>o().method()</code> i would like to use <code>o.method()</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I looked at the jquery source in attempt to find the solution to this with no avail: <a href=""http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.3.js"">http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.3.js</a></p>

"<p>I've been banging my head against SQL Server 2005 trying to get a lot of data out.  I've been given a database with nearly 300 tables in it and I need to turn this into a MySQL database.  My first call was to use bcp but unfortunately it doesn't produce valid CSV - strings aren't encapsulated, so you can't deal with any row that has a string with a comma in it (or whatever you use as a delimiter) and I would still have to hand write all of the create table statements, as obviously CSV doesn't tell you anything about the data types.</p>

<p>What would be better is if there was some tool that could connect to both SQL Server and MySQL, then do a copy. You lose views, stored procedures, trigger, etc, but it isn't hard to copy a table that only uses base types from one DB to another... is it?</p>

<p>Does anybody know of such a tool?  I don't mind how many assumptions it makes or what simplifications occur, as long as it supports integer, float, datetime and string. I have to do a lot of pruning, normalising, etc. anyway so I don't care about keeping keys, relationships or anything like that, but I need the initial set of data in fast!</p>

<p>Is there a way to tell the <code>ConfigurationManager</code> to just load the configuration from an arbitrary path (e.g. <code>..\web.config</code> if my assembly is in the <code>/bin</code> folder)?  If there is then I'm thinking my component can fall back to that if the default <code>ConfigurationManager.GetSection</code> returns <code>null</code> for my custom section.</p>

<p>Any other approaches to this would be welcome!</p>

"<p>Solutions are welcome in any language. :-) I'm looking for the fastest way to obtain the value of π, as a personal challenge. More specifically I'm using ways that don't involve using <code>#define</code>d constants like <code>M_PI</code>, or hard-coding the number in.</p>

<p>The program below tests the various ways I know of. The inline assembly version is, in theory, the fastest option, though clearly not portable; I've included it as a baseline to compare the other versions against. In my tests, with built-ins, the <code>4 * atan(1)</code> version is fastest on GCC 4.2, because it auto-folds the <code>atan(1)</code> into a constant. With <code>-fno-builtin</code> specified, the <code>atan2(0, -1)</code> version is fastest.</p>

<p>Here's the main testing program (<code>pitimes.c</code>):</p>

<pre class=""lang-c prettyprint-override""><code>#include &lt;math.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;time.h&gt;

#define ITERS 10000000

    for (i = 0; i &lt; ITERS; ++i)                                             \
        diff += (x) - M_PI;                                                 \
    time2 = clock();                                                        \
    printf(""%s\t=&gt; %e, time =&gt; %f\n"", #x, diff, diffclock(time2, time1));   \
}

static inline double
diffclock(clock_t time1, clock_t time0)

    return (double) (time1 - time0) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
}

int
main()
{
    int i;
    clock_t time1, time2;
    double diff;

    /* Warmup. The atan2 case catches GCC's atan folding (which would
     * optimise the ``4 * atan(1) - M_PI'' to a no-op), if -fno-builtin

    TESTWITH(2 * asin(1))
    TESTWITH(4 * atan2(1, 1))
    TESTWITH(4 * atan(1))

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the inline assembly stuff (<code>fldpi.c</code>), noting that it will only work for x86 and x64 systems:</p>

<pre class=""lang-c prettyprint-override""><code>double
fldpi()
{
    double pi;
    asm(""fldpi"" : ""=t"" (pi));
    return pi;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And a build script that builds all the configurations I'm testing (<code>build.sh</code>):</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
gcc -O3 -Wall -c           -m32 -o fldpi-32.o fldpi.c
gcc -O3 -Wall -c           -m64 -o fldpi-64.o fldpi.c

<p>Apart from testing between various compiler flags (I've compared 32-bit against 64-bit too, because the optimisations are different), I've also tried switching the order of the tests around. The <code>atan2(0, -1)</code> version still comes out top every time, though.</p>

<p>Update:
@Lars - I do use Enyim actually - it's very good, but what you're referring to is a client, rather than the server part.</p>

<p>@DannySmurf - I've only been able to install it as a service on a 32 bit OS. 64 bit OS rejects the installation of this Win32 service. Of course yes, lots of Win32 code works seamlessly on x64 architecture, hence you can run 32bit apps (like Office for instance) or games on Vista/XP 64 etc, but this doesn't translate directly when it comes to services. I'm no expert, I suspect that it has to do with the syncs or eventing that services need to subscribe to, and I suspect that 64 and 32 don't play nicely. I'm happy to be corrected on any of this, but to answer your question - yes I have tried.</p>

<p>@OJ - thanks very much for the straight-forward response. I thought as much, but wasn't sure if anyone else had suggestions or had already gone down this route. Maybe when StackOverflow is LIVE, then more people will respond and let me know if this is something being looked into, and although I can try and compile it myself - I simply can't ""trust"" (with my C++ experience level) that it would provide ""Enterprise Level"" reliability in such a crucial component of large scalable solutions.

<p><strong>EDIT 3</strong> </p>

<p>This was so simple following on from <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8941/generic-type-checking#8956"">Jon Limjaps Pointer</a>.. So simple I almost want to cry, but it's great because the code works like a charm!</p>

<p>So here is what I did (you'll laugh!):</p>

<h2>Code added to the generic class</h2>

<pre><code>bool TypeValid()
{
    // Get the TypeCode from the Primitive Type
    TypeCode code = Type.GetTypeCode(typeof(PrimitiveDataType));

    // All of the TypeCode Enumeration refer Primitive Types
    // with the exception of Object and Empty (Null).
    // Since I am willing to allow Null Types (at this time)
    // all we need to check for is Object!
    switch (code)
    {
        case TypeCode.Object:
            return false;
        default:
            return true;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then a little utility method to check the type and throw an exception,</p>

<pre><code>private void EnforcePrimitiveType()
{
    if (!TypeValid())
        throw new InvalidOperationException(
            ""Unable to Instantiate SimpleMetadata based on the Generic Type of '"" + typeof(PrimitiveDataType).Name + 
            ""' - this Class is Designed to Work with Primitive Data Types Only."");
}
</code></pre>

<p>All that then needs to be done is to call <em>EnforcePrimitiveType()</em> in the classes constructors. Job done! :-)</p>

<p>The only one downside, it only throws an exception at runtime (obviously) rather than design time.. But that's no big deal and could be picked up with utilities like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FxCop"" rel=""nofollow"">FxCop</a> (which we don't use at work).</p>

<p>I took an interest in making software cross-cultural after I read the famous post by Joel, <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html"" rel=""nofollow"">The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)</a>. However, I have yet to able to take advantage of this in a real project, besides making sure I used Unicode strings where possible. But making all your strings Unicode and ensuring you understand what encoding everything you work with is in is just the tip of the i18n iceberg.</p>

<p>Everything I have worked on to date has been for use by a controlled set of US English speaking people, or i18n just wasn't something we had time to work on before pushing the project live. So I am looking for any tips or war stories people have about making software more localized in real world projects.</p>

"<p>Should you set all the objects to <code>null</code> (<code>Nothing</code> in VB.NET) once you have finished with them? </p>

<p>I understand that in .NET it is essential to dispose of any instances of objects that implement the <code>IDisposable</code> interface to release some resources although the object can still be something after it is disposed (hence the <code>isDisposed</code> property in forms), so I assume it can still reside in memory or at least in part?</p>

<p>I also know that when an object goes out of scope it is then marked for collection ready for the next pass of the garbage collector (although this may take time).</p>

<p>So with this in mind will setting it to <code>null</code> speed up the system releasing the memory as it does not have to work out that it is no longer in scope and are they any bad side effects?</p>

<p>MSDN articles never do this in examples and currently I do this as I cannot 
see the harm. However I have come across a mixture of opinions so any comments are useful.</p>

"<p>I've read that it is possible to add a method to an existing object (e.g. not in the class definition) in <strong>python</strong>, I think this is called Monkey Patching (or in some cases Duck Punching).  I understand that it's not always a good decision to do so. But, how might one do this?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 8/04/2008 00:21:01 EST:</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/982"">That</a> looks like a good answer John Downey, I tried it but it appears that it ends up being not a <em>true</em> method.  Your example defines the new patch function with an argument of <strong>self</strong>, but if you write actual code that way, the now patched class method asks for an argument named self (it doesn't automagically recognize it as the object to which it is supposed to bind, which is what would happen if defined within the class definition), meaning you have to call <strong>class.patch(obj)</strong> instead of just <strong>class.patch()</strong> if you want the same functionality as a <em>true</em> method. <strong>It looks like python isn't really treating it as a method, but more just as a variable which happens to be a function</strong> (and as such is callable).  Is there any way to attach an actual method to a class?</p>

"<p>I'm working on a <strong>multithreaded</strong> C++ application that is corrupting the heap.  The usual tools to locate this corruption seem to be inapplicable.  Old builds (18 months old) of the source code exhibit the same behaviour as the most recent release, so this has been around for a long time and just wasn't noticed; on the downside, source deltas can't be used to identify when the bug was introduced - there are <em>a lot</em> of code changes in the repository.</p>

<p>The behaviour seems related to CPU power or memory bandwidth; the more of each the machine has, the easier it is to crash.  Disabling a hyper-threading core or a dual-core core reduces the rate of (but does not eliminate) corruption.  This suggests a timing related issue.</p>

When it's run under a lightweight debug environment (say <code>Visual Studio 98 / AKA MSVC6</code>) the heap corruption is reasonably easy to reproduce - ten or fifteen minutes pass before something fails horrendously and exceptions, like an <code>alloc;</code> when running under a sophisticated debug environment (Rational Purify, <code>VS2008/MSVC9</code> or even Microsoft Application Verifier) the system becomes memory-speed bound and doesn't crash (Memory-bound: CPU is not getting above <code>50%</code>, disk light is not on, the program's going as fast it can, box consuming <code>1.3G</code> of 2G of RAM).  So, <strong>I've got a choice between being able to reproduce the problem (but not identify the cause) or being able to idenify the cause or a problem I can't reproduce.</strong></p>

<p>My current best guesses as to where to next is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get an insanely grunty box (to replace the current dev box: 2Gb RAM in an <code>E6550 Core2 Duo</code>); this will make it possible to repro the crash causing mis-behaviour when running under a powerful debug environment; or</li>
<li>Rewrite operators <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code> to use <code>VirtualAlloc</code> and <code>VirtualProtect</code> to mark memory as read-only as soon as it's done with.  Run under <code>MSVC6</code> and have the OS catch the bad-guy who's writing to freed memory.  Yes, this is a sign of desperation: who the hell rewrites <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code>?!  I wonder if this is going to make it as slow as under Purify et al.</li>
</ol>

<p>And, no: Shipping with Purify instrumentation built in is not an option.</p>

<p>A colleague just walked past and asked ""Stack Overflow?  Are we getting stack overflows now?!?""</p>

<p>And now, the question: <strong>How do I locate the heap corruptor?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Update: balancing <code>new[]</code> and <code>delete[]</code> seems to have gotten a long way towards solving the problem.  Instead of 15mins, the app now goes about two hours before crashing.  Not there yet.  Any further suggestions? The heap corruption persists.</p>

<p>Update: a release build under Visual Studio 2008 seems dramatically better; current suspicion rests on the <code>STL</code> implementation that ships with <code>VS98</code>.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Reproduce the problem. <code>Dr Watson</code> will produce a dump that might be helpful in further analysis. </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>I'll take a note of that, but I'm concerned that Dr Watson will only be tripped up after the fact, not when the heap is getting stomped on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Another try might be using <code>WinDebug</code> as a debugging tool which is quite powerful being at the same time also lightweight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Got that going at the moment, again: not much help until something goes wrong.  I want to catch the vandal in the act.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Maybe these tools will allow you at least to narrow the problem to certain component.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't hold much hope, but desperate times call for...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And are you sure that all the components of the project have correct runtime library settings (<code>C/C++ tab</code>, Code Generation category in VS 6.0 project settings)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No I'm not, and I'll spend a couple of hours tomorrow going through the workspace (58 projects in it) and checking they're all compiling and linking with the appropriate flags.
<hR>
Update: This took 30 seconds.  Select all projects in the <code>Settings</code> dialog, unselect until you find the project(s) that don't have the right settings (they all had the right settings).</p>

"<p>I am working on a project that requires the manipulation of enormous matrices, particularly pyramidal summation for a copula calculation.  </p>

<p>In short, I need to keep track of a relatively small number of values (usually a value of 1, and in rare cases more than 1) in a sea of zeros in the matrix (multidimensional array).  </p>

<p>A sparse array allows the user to store a small number of values, and assume all undefined records to be a preset value.  Since it is not physically possibly to store all values in memory (greater in number than the number of particles in the universe :p ), I need to store only the few non-zero elements. This could be several million entries, I currently work on a system that uses a binary search tree (b-tree) to store entries.  </p>

<p>Does anyone know of a better system?</p>

"<p><a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/powershell/default.mspx"">Windows PowerShell</a> came out last year and got great reviews from many .net bloggers (<a href=""http://www.hanselman.com/blog/CategoryView.aspx?category=PowerShell"">Hanselman</a> comes to mind). It seemed to be touted as a great new utility that somehow made everything that you would ever do on the command line easier, and integrated with .Net. However, the more I read about it, the more it seems to be a tool that is great for IT professionals, and not much use for developers.</p>

<p>Do you use PowerShell in your dev work? If so, how? Is it worth learning? </p>

<p>Note: After seeing the responses so far, I think it is valid to conclude that PowerShell can be very useful to a .Net developer.

"<p>Does anyone have any good starting points for me when looking at making web pages/sites/applications specifically for viewing on the iPhone?</p>

<p>I've looked at templates like the one <a href=""http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2007/07/meet-joe-hewitt.html"">Joe Hewitt</a> has made, and also seen some templates I can purchase, which I haven't done yet.</p>

<p>I figured someone else had already started on this track and decided that I could probably leech on their newfound knowledge :)</p>

<p>So, does anyone have any pointers? I'm well aware of the problem that the more such a template/framework makes a web app look like a native iPhone app, the more likely I'm going to get into trouble because it just isn't, but for now I want a framework I can start building on, and then in the process figure out how to make it distinctive enough to be perceived as a web app as well as looking like a native iPhone application.</p>

<p>Specifically I'm looking for features like:</p>

<ul>
<li>stylesheets set up, or pointers to how to do them for iPhone</li>
<li>page flipping animation, ie. pick an item in a list, list scrolls out of view to the left and information for item scrolls in from the right</li>
<li>the animation part would have to work with dynamic pages, ie. not just one big page that has divs set up for each sub-item, which at least one such framework had as a sort of quick fix, I would need to have list item picking load the <em>page</em> for that item, and then when loaded, scroll to it</li>
</ul>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: To avoid people reading only the question and answering, before reading my other reply, I'll add my clarification for GPL licensing and similar issues here.</p>

<p>The framework I need to use can not be distributed under a license which would require me to license my own project out under a similar license. The GPL family of licenses allows for exceptions regarding library usage, but this won't apply to this since by necessity, the kind of framework I would need to use would be all source code.</p>

<p>The project can easily accomodate commercial libraries.</p>

<p>Also, I don't need a <em>library</em> or a <em>framework</em> as such, example files that look good and aren't overly obfuscated would be welcome as well.</p>

"<p><em>Note: This was posted when I was starting out C#. With 2014 knowledge, I can truly say that auto-properties are among the best things that ever happened to the C# language.</em></p>

<p>I am used to create my properties in C# using a private and a public field:</p>

<pre><code>private string title;
public string Title

    get { return title;  }
    set { title = value;  }
}

<p>Now, with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework"">.NET</a> 3.0, we got auto-properties:</p>

<pre><code>public string Title { get; set; }
</code></pre>

<p>I know this is more a philosophical/subjective questions, but is there any reason to use these auto-properties except from saving five lines of code for each field? My personal gripe is that those properties are hiding stuff from me, and I am not a big fan of black magic.</p>

<p>In fact, the hidden private field does not even show up in the debugger, which is OK given the fact that the get/set functions do nothing. But when I want to actually implement some getter/setter logic, I have to use the private/public pair anyway.</p>

<p>I see the benefit that I save a lot of code (one vs six lines) without losing the ability to change the getter/setter logic later, but then again I can already do that by simply declaring a public field ""Public string Title"" without the need of the { get; set; } block, thus even saving more code.</p>

<p>So, what am I missing here? Why would anyone actually want to use auto-properties?</p>

"<p>I've been raised to believe that if multiple threads can access a variable, then all reads from and writes to that variable must be protected by synchronization code, such as a ""lock"" statement, because the processor might switch to another thread halfway through a write.</p>

<pre><code>public static class Membership

    private static bool s_Initialized = false;
    private static object s_lock = new object();
    private static MembershipProvider s_Provider;

    public static MembershipProvider Provider

"<p>I've always preferred to use long integers as primary keys in databases, for simplicity and (assumed) speed. But when using a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer"">REST</a> or Rails-like URL scheme for object instances, I'd then end up with URLs like this:</p>

<pre><code>http://example.com/user/783<br></code></pre>

<p>And then the assumption is that there are also users with IDs of 782, 781, ..., 2, and 1. Assuming that the web app in question is secure enough to prevent people entering other numbers to view other users without authorization, a simple sequentially-assigned surrogate key also ""leaks"" the total number of instances (older than this one), in this case users, which might be privileged information. (For instance, I am user #726 in stackoverflow.)</p>

<p>Would a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uuid"">UUID</a>/GUID be a better solution? Then I could set up URLs like this:</p>

<pre><code>http://example.com/user/035a46e0-6550-11dd-ad8b-0800200c9a66<br></code></pre>

<p>Not exactly succinct, but there's less implied information about users on display. Sure, it smacks of ""security through obscurity"" which is no substitute for proper security, but it seems at least a little more secure.</p>

<p>Is that benefit worth the cost and complexity of implementing UUIDs for web-addressable object instances? I think that I'd still want to use integer columns as database PKs just to speed up joins.</p>

"<p>In a database-centric application that is designed for multiple clients, I've always thought it was ""better"" to use a single database for ALL clients - associating records with proper indexes and keys.  In listening to the Stack Overflow podcast, I heard Joel mention that FogBugz uses one database per client (so if there were 1000 clients, there would be 1000 databases).  What are the advantages of using this architecture?</p>

<p>I understand that for some projects, clients need direct access to all of their data - in such an application, it's obvious that each client needs their own database.  However, for projects where a client does not need to access the database directly, are there any advantages to using one database per client?  It seems that in terms of flexibility, it's much simpler to use a single database with a single copy of the tables.  It's easier to add new features, it's easier to create reports, and it's just easier to manage.</p>

"<p>I know the so-called textbook definition of unit tests and integration tests.  What I am curious about is when it is time to write unit tests... I will write them to cover as many sets of classes as possible.</p>

<p>For example, if I have a Word class, I will write some unit tests for the Word class.  Then, I begin writing my Sentence class, and when it needs to interact with the Word class, I will often write my unit tests such that they test both Sentence and Word... at least in the places where they interact.</p>

<p>Have these tests essentially become integration tests because they now test the integration of these 2 classes?  Or is it just a unit test that spans 2 classes?</p>

insert into myTable (Col1, Col2) values (@col1, @col2)

"<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>How would you go adding automated testing to a game?</p>

<p>I believe you can unit test a lot of the game engine's functionality (networking, object creation, memory management, etc), but is it possible to automate test the actual game itself?</p>

<p>I'm not talking about gameplay elements (like Protoss would beat Zerg in map X), but I'm talking about the interaction between the game and the engine.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>In game development, the engine is just a platform for the game. You could think of the game engine as an OS and the game as a software the OS would run. The game could be a collection of scripts or an actual subroutine inside the game engine.</p>

<p><strong>Possible Answers</strong></p>

<p>My idea is this: </p>

<p>You would need an engine that is deterministic. This means that given one set of input, the output would be exactly the same. This would inlude the random generator being seeded with the same input.</p>

<p>Then, create a bare-bone level which contains a couple of objects the avatar/user can interact with. Start small and then add objects into the level as more interactions are developed.</p>

<p>Create a script which follows a path (tests pathfinding) and interact with the different objects (store the result or expected behavior). This script would be your automated test. After a certain amount of time (say, one week), run the script along with your engine's unit tests.</p>

"<p>I've only done a bit of Flex development thus far, but I've preferred the approach of creating controls programmatically over mxml files, because (and <em>please</em>, correct me if I'm wrong!) I've gathered that you can't have it both ways -- that is to say, have the class functionality in a separate ActionScript class file but have the contained elements declared in mxml.</p>

<p>There doesn't seem to be much of a difference productivity-wise, but doing data binding programmatically seems somewhat less than trivial. I took a look at how the mxml compiler transforms the data binding expressions. The result is a bunch of generated callbacks and a lot more lines than in the mxml representation.

"<p>I have a silverlight 2 beta 2 application that accesses a WCF web service.  Because of this, it currently can only use basicHttp binding.  The webservice will return fairly large amounts of XML data.  This seems fairly wasteful from a bandwidth usage standpoint as the response, if zipped, would be smaller by a factor of 5 (I actually pasted the response into a txt file and zipped it.).  </p>

<p>The request does have the ""Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate"" - Is there any way have the WCF service gzip (or otherwise compress) the response?</p>

<p>I did find this <a href=""http://www.vistax64.com/indigo/113763-wcf-client-j2ee-server-using-gzip.html"">link</a> but it sure seems a bit complex for functionality that should be handled out-of-the-box IMHO.</p>

<p>OK - at first I marked the solution using the System.IO.Compression as the answer as I could never ""seem"" to get the IIS7 dynamic compression to work.  Well, as it turns out:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Dynamic Compression on IIS7 <strong>was</strong> working al along.  It is just that Nikhil's Web Developer Helper plugin for IE did not show it working.  My guess is that since SL hands the web service call off to the browser, that the browser handles it ""under the covers"" and Nikhil's tool never sees the compressed response.  I was able to confirm this by using Fiddler which monitors traffic external to the browser application.  In fiddler, the response was, in fact, gzip compressed!!</p></li>
<li><p>The other problem with the System.IO.Compression solution is that System.IO.Compression does not exist in the Silverlight CLR.</p></li>

"<p>We’ve found that the unit tests we’ve written for our C#/C++ code have really paid off. 
But we still have thousands of lines of business logic in stored procedures, which only really get tested in anger when our product is rolled out to a large number of users. </p>

<p>What makes this worse is that some of these stored procedures end up being very long, because of the performance hit when passing temporary tables between SPs. This has prevented us from refactoring to make the code simpler.</p>

<p>We have made several attempts at building unit tests around some of our key stored procedures (primarily testing the performance), but have found that setting up the test data for these tests is really hard. For example, we end up copying around test databases. In addition to this, the tests end up being really sensitive to change, and even the smallest change to a stored proc. or table requires a large amount of changes to the tests. So after many builds breaking due to these database tests failing intermittently, we’ve just had to pull them out of the build process.</p>

"<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>One of the things I've asked a lot about on this site is <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa904594.aspx"">LINQ</a>. The questions I've asked have been wide and varied and often don't have much context behind them. So in an attempt to consolidate the knowledge I've acquired on Linq I'm posting this question with a view to maintaining and updating it with additional information as I continue to learn about LINQ. </p>

<p>I also hope that it will prove to be a useful resource for other people wanting to learn about LINQ. </p>

<h2>What is LINQ?</h2>

<p>From <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa904594.aspx"">MSDN</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The LINQ Project is a codename for a
  set of extensions to the .NET
  Framework that encompass
  language-integrated query, set, and
  transform operations. It extends C#
  and Visual Basic with native language
  syntax for queries and provides class
  libraries to take advantage of these
  capabilities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What this means is that LINQ provides a standard way to query a variety of datasources using a common syntax. </p>

<h2>What flavours of LINQ are there?</h2>

<p>Currently there are a few different LINQ providers provided by Microsoft:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397919.aspx"">Linq to Objects</a> which allows you to execute queries on any IEnumerable object.  </li>
<li><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb425822.aspx"">Linq to SQL</a> which allows you to execute queries against a database in an object oriented manner.  </li>
<li><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb387098.aspx"">Linq to XML</a> which allows you to query, load, validate, serialize and manipulate XML documents.</li>
<li><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb386964.aspx"">Linq to Entities</a> as suggested by <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16322/all-about-linq#33588"">Andrei</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb399399.aspx"">Linq to Dataset</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There are quite a few others, many of which are listed <a href=""http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/vardi/archive/2008/10/09/the-linq-list-projects.aspx"">here</a>.</p>

<h2>What are the benefits?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Standardized way to query multiple datasources</li>
<li>Compile time safety of queries</li>
<li>Optimized way to perform set based operations on in memory objects</li>
<li>Ability to debug queries</li>
</ul>

<h2>What do I need to use LINQ?</h2>

<p>Linq is currently available in VB.Net 9.0 and C# 3.0 so you'll need Visual Studio 2008 or greater to get the full benefits. (You could always write your code in notepad and compile using MSBuild)</p>

<p>There is also a tool called <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7652/querying-like-linq-when-you-dont-have-linq#7710"">LinqBridge</a> which will allow you to run Linq like queries in C# 2.0. </p>

"<p>This morning, I was reading <a href=""http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/when-polymorphism-fails"">Steve Yegge's: When Polymorphism Fails</a>, when I came across a question that a co-worker of his used to ask potential employees when they came for their interview at Amazon.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As an example of polymorphism in
  action, let's look at the classic
  ""eval"" interview question, which (as
  far as I know) was brought to Amazon
  by Ron Braunstein. The question is
  quite a rich one, as it manages to
  probe a wide variety of important
  skills: OOP design, recursion, binary
  trees, polymorphism and runtime
  typing, general coding skills, and (if
  you want to make it extra hard)
  parsing theory.</p>
  
  <p>At some point, the candidate hopefully
  realizes that you can represent an
  arithmetic expression as a binary
  tree, assuming you're only using
  binary operators such as ""+"", ""-"",
  ""*"", ""/"". The leaf nodes are all
  numbers, and the internal nodes are
  all operators. Evaluating the
  expression means walking the tree. If
  the candidate doesn't realize this,
  you can gently lead them to it, or if
  necessary, just tell them.</p>
  
  <p>Even if you tell them, it's still an
  interesting problem.</p>
  
  <p>The first half of the question, which
  some people (whose names I will
  protect to my dying breath, but their
  initials are Willie Lewis) feel is a
  Job Requirement If You Want To Call
  Yourself A Developer And Work At
  Amazon, is actually kinda hard. The
  question is: how do you go from an
  arithmetic expression (e.g. in a
  string) such as ""2 + (2)"" to an
  expression tree. We may have an ADJ
  challenge on this question at some
  point.</p>
  
  <p>The second half is: let's say this is
  a 2-person project, and your partner,
  who we'll call ""Willie"", is
  responsible for transforming the
  string expression into a tree. You get
  the easy part: you need to decide what
  classes Willie is to construct the
  tree with. You can do it in any
  language, but make sure you pick one,
  or Willie will hand you assembly
  language. If he's feeling ornery, it
  will be for a processor that is no
  longer manufactured in production.</p>
  
  <p>You'd be amazed at how many candidates
  boff this one.</p>
  
  <p>I won't give away the answer, but a
  Standard Bad Solution involves the use
  of a switch or case statment (or just
  good old-fashioned cascaded-ifs). A
  Slightly Better Solution involves
  using a table of function pointers,
  and the Probably Best Solution
  involves using polymorphism. I
  encourage you to work through it
  sometime. Fun stuff!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, let's try to tackle the problem all three ways.  How do you go from an arithmetic expression (e.g. in a string) such as ""2 + (2)"" to an expression tree using cascaded-if's, a table of function pointers, and/or polymorphism?  </p>

<p>Feel free to tackle one, two, or all three.</p>

"<p>Or, actually establishing a build process when there isn't much of one in place to begin with.</p>

<p>Currently, that's pretty much the situation my group faces.  We do web-app development primarily (but no desktop development at this time).  Software deployments are ugly and unwieldy even with our modest apps, and we've had far too many issues crop up in the two years I have been a part of this team (and company).

Source Safe 6.0 (I know, but I can't do anything about whether or not we use Source Safe at this time.  That might be the next battle I fight.)</p>

<ol>
<li>Get source and place in local directory, including necessary DLLs needed for project.</li>
<li>Get config files and rename as needed (we're storing them in a special sub directory that isn't part of the actual application, and they are named according to use).</li>
<li>Build using Visual Studio</li>
<li>Precompile using command line, copying into what will be a ""build"" directory</li>
<li>Copy to destination.</li>
<li>Get any necessary additional resources - mostly things like documents, images, and reports that are associated with the project (and put into directory from step 5).  There's a lot of this stuff, and I didn't want to include it previously.  However, I'm going to only copy changed items, so maybe it's irrelevant.  I wasn't sure whether I really wanted to include this stuff in earlier steps.</li>
</ol>

<p>I still need to coax some logging out of Visual Build for all of this, but I'm not at a point where I need to do that yet.</p>

"<p>We have a four Linux boxes (all running Debian or Ubuntu) on our office network.  None of these boxes are especially critical and they're all using RAID.  To date, I've therefore been doing backups of the boxes by having a cron job upload tarballs containing the contents of /etc, MySQL dumps and other such changing, non-packaged data to a box at our geographically separate hosting centre.</p>

<p>I've realised, however that</p>

<ul>
<li>the tarballs are sufficient to rebuild from, but it's certainly not a painless process to do so (I recently tried this out as part of a hardware upgrade of one of the boxes)</li>
<li>long-term, the process isn't sustainable.  Each of the boxes is currently producing a tarball of a couple of hundred MB each day, 99% of which is the same as the previous day</li>
<li>partly due to the size issue, the backup process requires more manual intervention than I want (to find whatever 5GB file is inflating the size of the tarball and kill it)</li>
<li>again due to the size issue, I'm leaving stuff out which it would be nice to include - the contents of users' home directories, for example.  There's almost nothing of value there that isn't in source control (and these aren't our main dev boxes), but it would be nice to keep them anyway.</li>
<li>there must be a better way</li>
</ul>

<p>So, my question is, how should I be doing this properly?  The requirements are:</p>

<ul>
<li>needs to be an offsite backup (one of the main things I'm doing here is protecting against fire/whatever)</li>
<li>should require as little manual intervention as possible (I'm lazy, and box-herding isn't my main job)</li>
<li>should continue to scale with a couple more boxes, slightly more data, etc.</li>
<li>preferably free/open source (cost isn't the issue, but especially for backups, openness seems like a good thing)</li>
<li>an option to produce some kind of DVD/Blu-Ray/whatever backup from time to time wouldn't be bad</li>
</ul>

<p>My first thought was that this kind of incremental backup was what tar was created for - create a tar file once each month, add incrementally to it.  rsync results to remote box.  But others probably have better suggestions.</p>

"<p>I have been mulling over writing a peak fitting library for a while. I know Python fairly well and plan on implementing everything in Python to begin with but envisage that I may have to re-implement some core routines in a compiled language eventually.</p>

<p>What should I know about designing functions/classes which I envisage will have to interface into the compiled language?

<p>For this particular use case, (a fitting library) I imagine allowing users to define mathematical functions (Guassian, Lorentzian etc.) as Python functions which can then to be passed an interpreted by the compiled code fitting library. Passing and returning arrays is also essential.</p>

"<p>I'm currently working on an internal sales application for the company I work for, and I've got a form that allows the user to change the delivery address.</p>

<p>Now I think it would look much nicer, if the textarea I'm using for the main address details would just take up the area of the text in it, and automatically resize if the text was changed.</p>

<p>Here's a screenshot of it currently.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/XK48E.png"" alt=""ISO Address""></p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<hr>

<p>@Chris</p>

<p>A good point, but there are reasons I want it to resize, I want the area it takes up to be the area of the information contained in it.  As you can see in the screen shot, if I have a fixed textarea, it takes up a fair wack of vertical space.</p>

<p>I can reduce the font, but I need address to be large and readable.  Now I can reduce the size of the text area, but then I have problems with people who have an address line that takes 3 or 4 (one takes 5) lines.  Needing to have the user use a scrollbar is a major no-no.</p>

<p>I guess I should be a bit more specific, I'm after vertical resizing, the width doesn't matter as much.  The only problem that happens with that, is the ISO number (the large ""1"") gets pushed under the address when the window width is too small (as you can see on the screenshot).</p>

<p>It's not about having a gimick, it's about having a text field the user can edit that won't take up unnecessary space, but will show all the text in it.</p>

<p>Though if someone comes up with another way to approach the problem I'm open to that too.</p>

<p>Still, I'm over my head with this kind of stuff, so I thought I'd throw it out there.

I am using the .net <code>HttpListener</code> class, but I'm won't be running on IIS and am not using ASP.net.  This <a href=""http://www.leastprivilege.com/CommentView.aspx?guid=0c34094a-bdd4-4041-be6e-919f10fe1d31"">web site</a> describes what code to actual use to implement SSL with asp.net and <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/adarshk/archive/2004/11/10/255467.aspx"">this site</a> describes how to set up the certificates (although I'm not sure if it works only for IIS or not).  </p>

<p>When I the class documentation, it describes various types of authentication (basic, digest, Windows, etc.) - none of them refer to SSL.  It does say that if <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.httplistener.aspx"">HTTPS is used, you will need to set a server certificate</a>.  Is this going to be a one line property setting and <code>HttpListener</code> figures out the rest?  </p>

<p>In short, I need to know how to set up the certificates and how to modify the code to implement SSL.</p>

<p>Although it doesn't occur when I'm trying to access HTTPS, I did notice an error in my System Event log - the source is ""Schannel"" and the content of the message is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A fatal error occurred when attempting
  to access the SSL server credential
  private key. The error code returned
  from the cryptographic module is
  0x80090016.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Edit:<br>
<strong>Steps taken so far</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Created a working HTTPListener in C# that works for HTTP connections (e.g. ""http://localhost:8089/foldername/""</li>
<li>Created a certificate using makecert.exe</li>
<li>Added the certificate to be trusted using certmgr.exe</li>
<li>Used Httpcfg.exe to listen for SSL connections on a test port (e.g. 8090)</li>
<li>Added port 8080 to the HTTPListener via listener.Prefixes.Add(https://localhost:8090/foldername/"");</li>
<li>tested an HTTP client connection, e.g. (http://localhost:8089/foldername/"") in a browser and receive correct return</li>
<li>tested an HTTPS client connection, e.g. (http://localhost:8090/foldername/"") in a browser and receive ""Data Transfer Interrupted"" (in Firefox)</li>
<li>debugging in visual studio shows that the listener callback that receives the requests never gets hit when the HTTPS connection starts - I don't see any place that I could set a breakpoint to catch anything else earlier.</li>
<li>netstat shows that listening ports are open for both HTTPS and HTTP.  the HTTPS port does go to TIME_WAIT after a connection is attempted.</li>
<li><strong><a href=""http://www.fiddlertool.com/fiddler/"">Fiddler</a> and <a href=""http://www.ieinspector.com/httpanalyzer/"">HTTPAnalyzer</a> don't catch any of the traffic, I guess it doesn't get far enough in the process to show up in those HTTP analysis tools</strong></li>

<ul>
<li>What could the problem be? </li>
<li>Is there a piece of .Net code I am missing (meaning I have to do more in C# other than simply add a prefix to the listener that points to HTTPS, which is what i have done)</li>

"<p>I am often amazed at how little some of my colleagues know or care about their craft. Something that constantly frustrates me is that people don't want to learn any more than they need to about the programming languages they use every day.</p>

<p>Many programmers seem content to learn some pidgin sub-dialect, and stick with that. If they see a keyword or construct that they aren't familiar with, they'll complain that the code is ""tricky.""</p>

<p>What would you think of a civil engineer who shied away from calculus because it had ""all those tricky math symbols?""</p>

<p>I'm not suggesting that we all need to become ""language lawyers."" But if you make your living as a programmer, and claim to be a competent user of language X, then I think at a minimum you should know the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>the keywords of the language and what they do</li>
<li>the valid syntactic forms</li>
<li>how memory, files, and other operating system resources are managed</li>
<li>where the official language specification and library reference for the language is</li>
</ul>

<p>The last one is the one that really gets me. Many programmers seem to have no idea that there is a ""specification"" or ""standard"" for any particular language. I still talk to people who think that Microsoft invented C++, and that if a program doesn't compile under VC6, it's not a valid C++ program.</p>

<p>Programmers these days have it easy when it comes to obtaining specs. Newer languages like C#, Java, Python, Ruby, etc. all have their documentation available for free from the vendors' web sites. Older languages and platforms often have standards controlled by standards bodies that demand payment for specs, but even that shouldn't be a deterrent: the C++ standard is available from ISO for $30 (and why am I the only person I know who has a copy?).</p>

<p>Programming is hard enough even when you do know the language. If you don't, I don't see how you have a chance. </p>

<p>What do the rest of you think?  Am I right, or should we all be content with the typical level of programming language expertise?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Several great comments here.  Thanks.  A couple of people hit on something that I didn't think about:  What really irks me is not the lack of knowledge, but the lack of curiosity and willingness to learn.  It seems some people don't have any time to hone their craft, but they have plenty of time to write lots of bad code.</p>

<p>I don't expect people to be able to recite a list of keywords or EBNF expressions, or to spend their free time browsing through specs, but I do expect that when they see some code, they should have some inkling of what it does.  </p>

<p>Few people have complete knowledge of every dark corner of their language or platform, but everyone should at least know enough that when they see something unfamiliar, they will know how to get whatever additional information they need to understand it. It should be seen as an opportunity to learn something new, not an opportunity to complain about ""language lawyers"".</p>

"<p>What are some standard practices for managing a medium-large JavaScript application? My concerns are both speed for browser download and ease and maintainability of development.</p>

<p>Our JavaScript code is roughly ""namespaced"" as:</p>

   var2: '',

   accounts: {
      /* 100's of functions and variables */
   },

"<p>I've created a script that runs every night on my Linux server that uses <code>mysqldump</code> to back up each of my MySQL databases to .sql files and packages them together as a compressed .tar file.  The next step I want to accomplish is to send that tar file through email to a remote email server for safekeeping.  I've been able to send the raw script in the body an email by piping the backup text file to <code>mailx</code> like so:</p>

C++ applications on Linux?</a></li>

<p>My question, then:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>What good, C++ programming IDE is available for Linux?</em></p>

<p>The minimums are fairly standard: syntax highlighting, code completion (like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliSense"" rel=""nofollow"">intellisense</a> or its Eclipse counterpart) and integrated debugging (e.g., basic
breakpoints).</p>

"<p>For anyone that is passionate about software development, I'm of the opinion that you should always strive to write beautiful code; however, <strong>is there a clear definition of what beautiful code really is?</strong></p>

<p>On one hand, I see elegant code being something that's easy to read while simultaneously solving the problem at hand in the most efficient way possible. It seems like readable code often comes at the expense of, for example, creating several new variables in order to represent the data with which you're working. Depending on your platform (or depending on how picky you are), creating these variables could be considered to be a performance hit. </p>

<p>On the other hand, this brings up another perspective that I've often seen that defines beautiful code as code that succinctly and efficiently solves the given problem. It can be argued, though, that succinct code may come at the sake of readability and thus ultimately detracts from the attractiveness of the code.</p>

<p>I personally want to be able to write expressive, effective, and elegant code, but I often find myself debating if adding a couple of more variables to improve the readability of the code three months later really does improve (or pollute) the code.</p>

"<p>Ok, I realize I might be downvoted into oblivion for this question, especially given my stance on the matter, but I really need to see some honest, thoughtful debate on the merits of the currently accepted <strong><em>enterprise application</em></strong> design paradigm.</p>

<p>I am not convinced that entity objects should exist.</p>

<p>By entity objects I mean the typical things we tend to build for our applications, like ""Person"", ""Account"", ""Order"", etc.</p>

<p>My current design philosophy is this:</p>

<ul>
<li>All database access must be accomplished via stored procedures.</li>
<li>Whenever you need data, call a stored procedure and iterate over a SqlDataReader or the rows in a DataTable</li>
</ul>

<p>(Note: I have also built enterprise applications with Java EE, java folks please substitute the equvalent for my .NET examples)</p>

<p>I am not anti-OO.  I write lots of classes for different purposes, just not entities.  I will admit that a large portion of the classes I write are static helper classes.</p>

<p>I am not building toys.  I'm talking about large, high volume transactional applications deployed across multiple machines.  Web applications, windows services, web services, b2b interaction, you name it.</p>

<p>I have used OR Mappers.  I have written a few.  I have used the Java EE stack, CSLA, and a few other equivalents.  I have not only used them but actively developed and maintained these applications in production environments.</p>

<p>I have come to the battle-tested conclusion that entity objects are getting in our way, and our lives would be <em>so</em> much easier without them.</p>

<p>Consider this simple example: you get a support call about a certain page in your application that is not working correctly, maybe one of the fields is not being persisted like it should be.  With my model, the developer assigned to find the problem opens <em>exactly 3 files</em>.  An ASPX, an ASPX.CS and a SQL file with the stored procedure.  The problem, which might be a missing parameter to the stored procedure call, takes minutes to solve.  But with any entity model, you will invariably fire up the debugger, start stepping through code, and you may end up with 15-20 files open in Visual Studio.  By the time you step down to the bottom of the stack, you forgot where you started.  We can only keep so many things in our heads at one time.  Software is incredibly complex without adding any unnecessary layers.</p>

<p>Development complexity and troubleshooting are just one side of my gripe.</p>

<p>Now let's talk about scalability.</p>

<p>Do developers realize that each and every time they write or modify any code that interacts with the database, they need to do a throrough analysis of the exact impact on the database?  And not just the development copy, I mean a mimic of production, so you can see that the additional column you now require for your object just invalidated the current query plan and a report that was running in 1 second will now take 2 minutes, just because you added a single column to the select list?  And it turns out that the index you now require is so big that the DBA is going to have to modify the physical layout of your files?</p>

<p>If you let people get too far away from the physical data store with an abstraction, they will create havoc with an application that needs to scale.</p>

<p>I am not a zealot.  I can be convinced if I am wrong, and maybe I am, since there is such a strong push towards Linq to Sql, ADO.NET EF, Hibernate, Java EE, etc.  Please think through your responses, if I am missing something I really want to know what it is, and why I should change my thinking.</p>

<p><em><strong>[Edit]</em></strong></p>

<p>It looks like this question is suddenly active again, so now that we have the new comment feature I have commented directly on several answers.  Thanks for the replies, I think this is a healthy discussion.</p>

<p>I probably should have been more clear that I am talking about enterprise applications.  I really can't comment on, say, a game that's running on someone's desktop, or a mobile app.</p>

<p>One thing I have to put up here at the top in response to several similar answers: orthogonality and separation of concerns often get cited as reasons to go entity/ORM.  Stored procedures, to me, are the best example of separation of concerns that I can think of.  If you disallow all other access to the database, other than via stored procedures, you could in theory redesign your entire data model and not break any code, so long as you maintained the inputs and outputs of the stored procedures.  They are a perfect example of programming by contract (just so long as you avoid ""select *"" and document the result sets).</p>

<p>Ask someone who's been in the industry for a long time and has worked with long-lived applications: how many application and UI layers have come and gone while a database has lived on?  How hard is it to tune and refactor a database when there are 4 or 5 different persistence layers generating SQL to get at the data?  You can't change anything!  ORMs or any code that generates SQL <strong><em>lock your database in stone</em></strong>.</p>

"<p>I'm trying to redirect all requests to my domain to another domain using mod_rewrite in an Apache 2.2 VirtualHost declaration.  There is one exception to this -- I'd like all requests  to the <code>/audio</code> path <em>not</em> to be redirected.</p>

<p>I've written a RewriteCond and RewriteRule to do this but it's not quite right and I can't figure out why.  The regular expression contains a negative lookahead for the string ""/audio"", but for some reason this isn't matching.  Here's the definition:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^(.*\.)?mydomain\.net(?!/audio) [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.newdomain.net [L,R=301]

<pre><code>RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^(.*\.)?mydomain\.net/(?!audio) [NC]
</code></pre>

<p>(i.e. put the forward slash outside of the negative lookahead part) then it works, but the downside of this is that requests to mydomain.net without a trailing slash will not be redirected.</p>

<p>Can anyone point out what I'm doing wrong?</p>

<p>(Note: the angle brackets around the domain in the RewriteRule bit above are being added by StackOverflow.com -- they are not there in the actual code!)</p>

ServerAlias mydomain.net

(3) applying pattern '^(.*)$' to uri '/audio'
(2) rewrite '/audio' -&gt; 'http://www.newdomain.net/'
(2) explicitly forcing redirect with http://www.newdomain.net
(1) escaping http://www.newdomain.net for redirect
(1) redirect to http://www.newdomain.net [REDIRECT/301]

<p>I am already using the SqlClient.SqlBulkCopy (which is based on TDS) to speed up the data transfer across the wire which helped a lot, but I'm still looking for more.</p>

<p>I have a simple table that looks like this: </p>

<pre><code> CREATE TABLE [BulkData](
 [ContainerId] [int] NOT NULL,
 [BinId] [smallint] NOT NULL,
 [Sequence] [smallint] NOT NULL,
 [ItemId] [int] NOT NULL,
 [Left] [smallint] NOT NULL,
 [Top] [smallint] NOT NULL,
 [Right] [smallint] NOT NULL,
 [Bottom] [smallint] NOT NULL,
 CONSTRAINT [PKBulkData] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED 
 (
  [ContainerIdId] ASC,
  [BinId] ASC,
  [Sequence] ASC
))

<p>I'm inserting data in chunks that average about 300 rows where ContainerId and BinId are constant in each chunk and the Sequence value is 0-n and the values are pre-sorted based on the primary key.  </p>

<p>The %Disk time performance counter spends a lot of time at 100% so it is clear that disk IO is the main issue but the speeds I'm getting are several orders of magnitude below a raw file copy.</p>

<p>Does it help any if I:</p>

<ol>
<li>Drop the Primary key while I am doing the inserting and recreate it later</li>
<li>Do inserts into a temporary table with the same schema and periodically transfer them into the main table to keep the size of the table where insertions are happening small</li>
<li>Anything else?</li>
</ol>

<p>--
Based on the responses I have gotten, let me clarify a little bit:</p>

<p>Portman: I'm using a clustered index because when the data is all imported I will need to access data sequentially in that order.  I don't particularly need the index to be there while importing the data.  Is there any advantage to having a nonclustered PK index while doing the inserts as opposed to dropping the constraint entirely for import?</p>

<p>Chopeen:  The data is being generated remotely on many other machines (my SQL server can only handle about 10 currently, but I would love to be able to add more).  It's not practical to run the entire process on the local machine because it would then have to process 50 times as much input data to generate the output.</p>

<p>Jason: I am not doing any concurrent queries against the table during the import process, I will try dropping the primary key and see if that helps.</p>

<p>I have my main form validation done using the built in .Net Validation Controls, but now I need to verify that the data sufficiently satisfies the criteria for the Service Layer.</p>

<li>Refering user entered does not exist (failure)</li>
<li>Password length exceeds datastore allowed length (failure)</li>
<li>Member created successfully (success)</li>

<p>Let's also say that more rules will be in the service layer that the UI cannot anticipate.</p>

<p>Currently I'm having the service layer throw an exception if things didn't go as planned. Is that a sufficent strategy? Does this code smell to you guys? If I wrote a service layer like this would you be annoyed at having to write Presenters that use it in this way? Return codes seem too old school and a bool is just not informative enough.</p>

  <p><strong>Edit not by OP: merging in follow-up comments that were posted as answers by the OP</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Cheekysoft, I like the concept of a ServiceLayerException. I already have a global exception module for the exceptions that I don't anticipate. Do you find making all these custom exceptions tedious? I was thinking that catching base Exception class was a bit smelly but wasn't exactly sure how progress from there.</p>

<p>tgmdbm, I like the clever use of the lambda expression there!</p>

<hr>

<p>Thanks Cheekysoft for the follow-up. So I'm guessing that would be the strategy if you don't mind the user being displayed a separate page (I'm primarily a web developer) if the Exception is not handled.</p>

<p>However, if I want to return the error message in the same view where the user submitted the data that caused the error, I would then have to catch the Exception in the Presenter?</p>

<p>Here's what the CreateUserView looks like when the Presenter has handled the ServiceLayerException:</p>

I like books that are heavy on examples but also include challenges to work through.  Does such a thing exist for functional languages?</p>

"<p>As far as I can tell, in spite of the countless millions or billions spent on OOP education, languages, and tools, OOP has not improved developer productivity or software reliability, nor has it reduced development costs. Few people use OOP in any rigorous sense (few people adhere to or understand principles such as LSP); there seems to be little uniformity or consistency to the approaches that people take to modelling problem domains.  All too often, the class is used simply for its syntactic sugar; it puts the functions for a record type into their own little namespace.</p>

<p>I've written a large amount of code for a wide variety of applications. Although there have been places where true substitutable subtyping played a valuable role in the application, these have been pretty exceptional. In general, though much lip service is given to talk of ""re-use"" the reality is that unless a piece of code does <em>exactly</em> what you want it to do, there's very little cost-effective ""re-use"".  It's extremely hard to design classes to be extensible <em>in the right way</em>, and so the cost of extension is normally so great that ""re-use"" simply isn't worthwhile.</p>

The real world isn't ""OO"", and the idea implicit in OO--that we can model things with some class taxonomy--seems to me very fundamentally flawed (I can sit on a table, a tree stump, a car bonnet, someone's lap--but not one of those is-a chair).  Even if we move to more abstract domains, OO modelling is often difficult, counterintuitive, and ultimately unhelpful (consider the classic examples of circles/ellipses or squares/rectangles).</p>

What happens if the first program generates data significantly faster than the second program?

"<p>I do some minor programming and web work for a local community college. Work that includes maintaining a very large and soul destroying website that consists of a hodge podge of VBScript, javascript, Dreamweaver generated cruft and a collection of add-ons that various conmen have convinced them to buy over the years. </p>

<p>A few days ago I got a call ""The website is locking up for people using Safari!"" Okay, step one download Safari(v3.1.2), step two surf to the site. Everything appears to work fine.</p>

<p>Long story short I finally isolated the problem and it relates to Safari's back button. The website uses a fancy-pants javascript menu that works in every browser I've tried including Safari, the first time around. But in Safari if you follow a link off the page and then hit the back button the menu no longer works.</p>

<p>I made a pared down webpage to illustrate the principle.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN""&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Safari Back Button Test&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=""Content-Type"" content=""text/html; charset=iso-8859-1""&gt;

&lt;a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com""&gt;Coding Horror&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

<p>Load the page and you see the alert box. Then follow the link off the page and hit the back button. In IE and Firefox you see the alert box again, in Safari you do not.</p>

<p>After a vigorous googling I've discovered others with similar problems but no really satisfactory answers. So my question is how can I make my pages work the same way in Safari after the user hits the back button as they do in other browsers?</p>

"<p>We're seeing some pernicious, but rare, deadlock conditions in the Stack Overflow SQL Server 2005 database.</p>

<p>I attached the profiler, set up a trace profile using <a href=""http://www.simple-talk.com/sql/learn-sql-server/how-to-track-down-deadlocks-using-sql-server-2005-profiler/"">this excellent article on troubleshooting deadlocks</a>, and captured a bunch of examples. The weird thing is that <strong>the deadlocking write is <em>always</em> the same</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE [dbo].[Posts]
SET [AnswerCount] = @p1, [LastActivityDate] = @p2, [LastActivityUserId] = @p3
WHERE [Id] = @p0
</code></pre>

<p>The other deadlocking statement varies, but it's usually some kind of trivial, simple <strong>read</strong> of the posts table. This one always gets killed in the deadlock. Here's an example</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
[t0].[Id], [t0].[PostTypeId], [t0].[Score], [t0].[Views], [t0].[AnswerCount], 
[t0].[AcceptedAnswerId], [t0].[IsLocked], [t0].[IsLockedEdit], [t0].[ParentId], 
[t0].[CurrentRevisionId], [t0].[FirstRevisionId], [t0].[LockedReason],
[t0].[LastActivityDate], [t0].[LastActivityUserId]
FROM [dbo].[Posts] AS [t0]
WHERE [t0].[ParentId] = @p0
</code></pre>

<p>To be perfectly clear, we are not seeing write / write deadlocks, but read / write.</p>

<p>We have a mixture of LINQ and parameterized SQL queries at the moment. We have added <code>with (nolock)</code> to all the SQL queries. This may have helped some. We also had a single (very) poorly-written badge query that I fixed yesterday, which was taking upwards of 20 seconds to run every time, and was running every minute on top of that. I was hoping this was the source of some of the locking problems!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I got another deadlock error about 2 hours ago. Same exact symptoms, same exact culprit write.</p>

<p>The truly strange thing is that the locking write SQL statement you see above is part of a very specific code path. It's <em>only</em> executed when a new answer is added to a question -- it updates the parent question with the new answer count and last date/user. This is, obviously, not that common relative to the massive number of reads we are doing! As far as I can tell, we're not doing huge numbers of writes anywhere in the app.</p>

<p>I realize that NOLOCK is sort of a giant hammer, but most of the queries we run here don't need to be that accurate. Will you care if your user profile is a few seconds out of date?</p>

<p>Using NOLOCK with Linq is a bit more difficult as <a href=""http://www.hanselman.com/blog/GettingLINQToSQLAndLINQToEntitiesToUseNOLOCK.aspx"">Scott Hanselman discusses here</a>.</p>

<p>We are flirting with the idea of using</p>

<pre><code>SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED
</code></pre>

<p>on the base database context so that all our LINQ queries have this set. Without that, we'd have to wrap every LINQ call we make (well, the simple reading ones, which is the vast majority of them) in a 3-4 line transaction code block, which is ugly.</p>

<p>I guess I'm a little frustrated that trivial reads in SQL 2005 can deadlock on writes. I could see write/write deadlocks being a huge issue, but <em>reads?</em> We're not running a banking site here, we don't need perfect accuracy every time.</p>

<p>Ideas? Thoughts?</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are you instantiating a new LINQ to SQL DataContext object for every operation or are you perhaps sharing the same static context for all your calls?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jeremy, we are sharing one static datacontext in the base Controller for the most part:</p>

<pre><code>private DBContext _db;
/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Gets the DataContext to be used by a Request's controllers.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;

{

"<p>Before you answer this I have never developed anything popular enough to attain high server loads. Treat me as (sigh) an alien that has just landed on the planet, albeit one that knows PHP and a few optimisation techniques.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm developing a tool in <strong>PHP</strong> that could attain quite a lot of users, if it works out right. However while I'm fully capable of developing the program I'm pretty much clueless when it comes to making something that can deal with huge traffic. So here's a few questions on it (feel free to turn this question into a resource thread as well).</p>

<h2>Databases</h2>

<p>At the moment I plan to use the MySQLi features in PHP5. However how should I setup the databases in relation to users and content? Do I actually <em>need</em> multiple databases? At the moment everything's jumbled into one database - although I've been considering spreading user data to one, actual content to another and finally core site content (template masters etc.) to another. My reasoning behind this is that sending queries to different databases will ease up the load on them as one database = 3 load sources. Also would this still be effective if they were all on the same server?</p>

<h2>Caching</h2>

<p>I have a template system that is used to build the pages and swap out variables. Master templates are stored in the database and each time a template is called it's cached copy (a html document) is called. At the moment I have two types of variable in these templates - a static var and a dynamic var. Static vars are usually things like page names, the name of the site - things that don't change often; dynamic vars are things that change on each page load.</p>

<p>My question on this:</p>

<p>Say I have comments on different articles. Which is a better solution: store the simple comment template and render comments (from a DB call) each time the page is loaded or store a cached copy of the comments page as a html page - each time a comment is added/edited/deleted the page is recached.</p>

"<p>I've had a lot of good experiences learning about web development on <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">w3schools.com</a>. It's hit or miss, I know, but the PHP and CSS sections specifically have proven very useful for reference.</p>

<p>Anyway, I was wondering if there was a similar site for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery"" rel=""nofollow"">jQuery</a>. I'm interested in learning, but I need it to be online/searchable, so I can refer back to it easily when I need the information in the future.</p>

<p>Also, as a brief aside, is jQuery worth learning? Or should I look at different JavaScript libraries? I know Jeff uses jQuery on Stack Overflow and it seems to be working well.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: jQuery's website has a <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials"" rel=""nofollow"">pretty big list of tutorials</a>, and a seemingly comprehensive <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation page</a>. I haven't had time to go through it all yet, has anyone else had experience with it?</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong>: It seems Google is now hosting the jQuery libraries. That should give jQuery a pretty big advantage in terms of publicity. </p>

<p>Also, if everyone uses a single unified aQuery library hosted at the same place, it should get cached for most Internet users early on and therefore not impact the download footprint of your site should you decide to use it.</p>

<h2>2 Months Later...</h2>

<p><strong>Edit 3</strong>: I started using jQuery on a project at work recently and it is great to work with! Just wanted to let everyone know that I have concluded it is <strong><em>ABSOLUTELY</em></strong> worth it to learn and use jQuery.</p>

<p>Also, I learned almost entirely from the Official jQuery <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation</a> and <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials"" rel=""nofollow"">tutorials</a>. It's very straightforward.</p>

<p>jQuery is a part of just about every web app I've made since I initially wrote this post. It makes progressive enhancement a breeze, and helps make the code maintainable.</p>

"<p>JavaScript needs access to cookies if AJAX is used on a site with access restrictions based on cookies. Will HttpOnly cookies work on an AJAX site? </p>

<p><em>Edit:</em> Microsoft created a way to prevent XSS attacks by disallowing JavaScript access to cookies if HttpOnly is specified. FireFox later adopted this. So my question is: If you are using AJAX on a site, like StackOverflow, are Http-Only cookies an option?</p>

<p><em>Edit 2:</em> Question 2. If the purpose of HttpOnly is to prevent JavaScript access to cookies, and you can still retrieve the cookies via JavaScript through the XmlHttpRequest Object, <strong>what is the point of HttpOnly</strong>?</p>

<p><em>Edit 3:</em> Here is a quote from Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the browser receives such a cookie, it is supposed to use it as usual in the following HTTP exchanges, but not to make it visible to client-side scripts.[32] The <code>HttpOnly</code> flag is not part of any standard, and is not implemented in all browsers. Note that there is currently no prevention of reading or writing the session cookie via a XMLHTTPRequest. [33].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand that <code>document.cookie</code> is blocked when you use HttpOnly. But it seems that you can still read cookie values in the XMLHttpRequest object, allowing for XSS. How does HttpOnly make you any safer than? By making cookies essentially read only? </p>

<p>In your example, I cannot write to your <code>document.cookie</code>, but I can still steal your cookie and post it to my domain using the XMLHttpRequest object.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    var req = null;
    try { req = new XMLHttpRequest(); } catch(e) {}
    if (!req) try { req = new ActiveXObject(""Msxml2.XMLHTTP""); } catch(e) {}
    if (!req) try { req = new ActiveXObject(""Microsoft.XMLHTTP""); } catch(e) {}
    req.open('GET', 'http://stackoverflow.com/', false);
    req.send(null);
    alert(req.getAllResponseHeaders());
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><em>Edit 4:</em> Sorry, I meant that you could send the XMLHttpRequest to the StackOverflow domain, and then save the result of getAllResponseHeaders() to a string, regex out the cookie, and then post that to an external domain. It appears that Wikipedia and ha.ckers concur with me on this one, but I would love be re-educated...</p>

<p><em>Final Edit:</em> Ahh, apparently both sites are wrong, this is actually a <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=380418"">bug in FireFox</a>. IE6 &amp; 7 are actually the only browsers that currently fully support HttpOnly.</p>

<p>To reiterate everything I've learned:</p>

<ul>
<li>HttpOnly restricts all access to document.cookie in IE7 &amp; and FireFox (not sure about other browsers)</li>
<li>HttpOnly removes cookie information from the response headers in XMLHttpObject.getAllResponseHeaders() in IE7.</li>
<li>XMLHttpObjects may only be submitted to the domain they originated from, so there is no cross-domain posting of the cookies.</li>

<li>how to set it up in the calling application</li>

<p>This will add a <code>TextWriterTraceListener</code> that will catch everything you send to with <code>Trace.WriteLine</code> etc.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> @DanEsparza pointed out that you should use <code>Trace.TraceInformation</code>, <code>Trace.TraceWarning</code> and <code>Trace.TraceError</code> instead of <code>Trace.WriteLine</code>, as they allow you to format messages the same way as <code>string.Format</code>.</p>

"<p>I've developed an equation parser using a simple stack algorithm that will handle binary (+, -, |, &amp;, *, /, etc) operators, unary (!) operators, and parenthesis.</p>

<p>Using this method, however, leaves me with everything having the same precedence - it's evaluated left to right regardless of operator, although precedence can be enforced using parenthesis.</p>

<p>So right now ""1+11*5"" returns 60, not 56 as one might expect.</p>

<p>While this is suitable for the current project, I want to have a general purpose routine I can use for later projects.</p>

<p><strong>Edited for clarity:</strong></p>

<p>What is a good algorithm for parsing equations with precedence?</p>

<p>I'm interested in something simple to implement and understand that I can code myself to avoid licensing issues with available code.</p>

<p><strong>Grammar:</strong></p>

<p>I don't understand the grammar question - I've written this by hand.  It's simple enough that I don't see the need for YACC or Bison.  I merely need to calculate strings with equations such as ""2+3 * (42/13)"".</p>

<p><strong>Language:</strong></p>

<p>I'm doing this in C, but I'm interested in an algorithm, not a language specific solution.  C is low level enough that it'll be easy to convert to another language should the need arise.</p>

<p><strong>Code Example</strong></p>

<p>I posted the <a href=""http://www.ubasics.com/simple%5Fc%5Fequation%5Fparser"">test code for the simple expression parser</a> I was talking about above.  The project requirements altered and so I never needed to optimize the code for performance or space as it wasn't incorporated into the project.  It's in the original verbose form, and should be readily understandable.  If I do anything further with it in terms of operator precedence, I'll probably choose <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28256/equation-expression-parser-with-precedence/783132#783132"">the macro hack</a> because it matches the rest of the program in simplicity.  If I ever use this in a real project, though, I'll be going for a more compact/speedy parser.</p>

"<p>In VS .NET, when you are selecting a folder for a project, a dialog that looks like an OpenFileDialog or SaveFileDialog is displayed, but is set up to accept only folders.  Ever since I've seen this I've wanted to know how it's done.  I am aware of the FolderBrowserDialog, but I've never really liked that dialog.  It starts too small and doesn't let me take advantage of being able to type a path.</p>

<p>I'm almost certain by now there's not a way to do this from .NET, but I'm just as curious how you do it from unmanaged code as well.  Short of completely reimplementing the dialog from scratch, how do you modify the dialog to have this behavior?</p>

<p>I'd also like to restate that I am aware of the FolderBrowserDialog but sometimes I don't like to use it, in addition to being genuinely curious how to configure a dialog in this manner.  Telling me to just use the FolderBrowserDialog helps me maintain a consistent UI experience but doesn't satisfy my curiosity so it won't count as an answer.</p>

<p>It's not a Vista-specific thing either; I've been seeing this dialog since VS .NET 2003, so it is doable in Win2k and WinXP.  This is less of a ""I want to know the proper way to do this"" question and more of a ""I have been curious about this since I first wanted to do it in VS 2003"" question.  I understand that Vista's file dialog has an option to do this, but it's been working in XP so I know they did <em>something</em> to get it to work.  Vista-specific answers are not answers, because Vista doesn't exist in the question context.</p>

<p><strong>Update: I'm accepting Scott Wisniewski's answer because it comes with a working sample, but I think Serge deserves credit for pointing to the dialog customization (which is admittedly nasty from .NET but it <em>does</em> work) and Mark Ransom for figuring out that MS probably rolled a custom dialog for this task.</strong></p>

"<p>For the past few weeks, I've been trying to learn about just how email works.  I understand the process of a client receiving mail from a server using POP pretty well.  I also understand how a client computer can use SMTP to ask an SMTP server to send a message.  However, I'm still missing something...</p>

<p>The way I understand it, outgoing mail has to make three trips:</p>

<ol>
<li>Client (gmail user using Thunderbird) to a server (Gmail)</li>
<li>First server (Gmail) to second server (Hotmail)</li>
<li>Second server (Hotmail) to second client (hotmail user using OS X Mail)</li>
</ol>

<p>As I understand it, step one uses SMTP for the client to communicate.  The client authenticates itself somehow (say, with USER and PASS), and then sends a message to the gmail server.</p>

<p>However, I don't understand how gmail server transfers the message to the hotmail server.</p>

<p>For step three, I'm pretty sure, the hotmail server uses POP to send the message to the hotmail client (using authentication, again).</p>

<p>So, the big question is: <strong>when I click send Mail sends my message to my gmail server, how does my gmail server forward the message to, say, a hotmail server so my friend can recieve it?</strong></p>

<p>Then, SOMESERVER uses SMTP again to send the message to RECEIVESERVER.com on port 25 (not smtp.mail.RECEIVESERVER.com or anything fancy).</p>

I prefer the Silverlight platform over the Flex platform for the simple fact that Silverlight is all .NET code.  We have more .NET developers on staff than Flash/Flex developers, and most of our Flash/Flex developers are graphic artists (not real programmers).  Only reason they push towards Flex right now is because it seems like the logical step from Flash.</p>

<p>I've done development using both, and I honestly believe Silverlight is easier to work with.  But I'm trying to convince people who are only Flash developers. </p>

<p>So here's my question:  If I'm going to go into a meeting to praise Silverlight, why would a company want to go with Silverlight instead of Flex?  Other than the obvious ""not everyone has Silverlight"", what are the pros and cons for each?</p>

"<p>I'm playing around with a native (non-web) single-player game I'm writing, and it occured to me that having a daily/weekly/all-time <strong>online highscore list</strong> (think Xbox Live Leaderboard) would make the game much more interesting, adding some (small) amount of community and competition. However, I'm afraid people would see such a feature as an invitation to hacking, which would discourage regular players due to impossibly high scores.</p>

<p>I thought about the obvious ways of preventing such attempts (public/private key encryption, for example), but I've figured out reasonably simple ways hackers could circumvent all of my ideas (extracting the public key from the binary and thus sending fake encrypted scores, for example).</p>

"<p>There are two weird operators in C#:</p>

<ul>

<li>the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6292hy1k.aspx"">false operator</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If I understand this right these operators can be used in types which I want to use instead of a boolean expression and where I don't want to provide an implicit conversion to bool.</p>

<p>Let's say I have a following class:</p>

<pre><code>    public class MyType
    {
        public readonly int Value;

        public MyType(int value)
        {
            Value = value;
        }

        public static bool operator true (MyType mt)
        {
            return  mt.Value &gt; 0;
        }

        public static bool operator false (MyType mt)
        {
            return  mt.Value &lt; 0;
        }

    }
</code></pre>

<p>So I can write the following code:</p>

<pre><code>    MyType mTrue = new MyType(100);
    MyType mFalse = new MyType(-100);
    MyType mDontKnow = new MyType(0);

    if (mTrue)
    {
         // Do something.
    }

    while (mFalse)
    {
        // Do something else.
    }

    do
    {
        // Another code comes here.
    } while (mDontKnow)

<p>Does it make a difference if the collection is an array (i.e., objList.Clone()) versus a List?</p>

<p>If returning the actual collection as a reference is so bad because it creates dependencies, then why return any property as a reference? Anytime you expose an child object as a reference the internals of that child can be changed without the parent ""knowing"" unless the child has a property changed event.

<p>And, don't options 2 and 3 break serialization? Is this a catch 22 or do you have to implement custom serialization anytime you have a collection property?</p>

<p>The generic ReadOnlyCollection seems like a nice compromise for general use. It wraps an IList and restricts access to it.  Maybe this helps with memory leaks and serialization.  However it still has <a href=""http://www.coversant.net/Coversant/Blogs/tabid/88/EntryID/34/Default.aspx"">enumeration concerns</a> </p>

"<p>It seems to me that it would work perfectly well to do tail-recursion optimization in both C and C++, yet while debugging I never seem to see a frame stack that indicates this optimization. That is kind of good, because the stack tells me how deep the recursion is. However, the optimization would be kind of nice as well.</p>

<p>Do any C++ compilers do this optimization? Why? Why not?</p>

<p>How do I go about telling the compiler to do it?</p>

<ul>
<li>For MSVC: /O2 or /Ox</li>
<li>For GCC: -O2 or -O3</li>
</ul>

<p>How about checking if the compiler has done this in a certain case?</p>

<ul>
<li>For MSVC, enable PDB output to be able to trace the code, then inspect the code</li>
<li>For GCC..?</li>
</ul>

<p>I'd still take suggestions for how to determine if a certain function is optimized like this by the compiler (even though I find it reassuring that Konrad tells me to assume it)</p>

<p>It is always possible to check if the compiler does this at all by making an infinite recursion and checking if it results in an infinite loop or a stack overflow (I did this with GCC and found out that -O2 is sufficient), but I want to be able to check a certain function that I know will terminate anyway. I'd love to have an easy way of checking this :)</p>

<hr>

<p>After some testing, I discovered that destructors ruin the possibility of making this optimization. It can sometimes be worth it to change the scoping of certain variables and temporaries to make sure they go out of scope before the return-statement starts.</p>

<p>If any destructor needs to be run after the tail-call, the tail-call optimization can not be done.</p>

"<p>We are currently working in a private beta and so are still in the process of making fairly rapid changes, although obviously as usage is starting to ramp up, we will be slowing down this process.  That being said, one issue we are running into is that after we push out an update with new JavaScript files, the client browsers still use the cached version of the file and they do not see the update.  Obviously, on a support call, we can simply inform them to do a <kbd>ctrl</kbd><kbd>F5</kbd> refresh to ensure that they get the up-to-date files from the server, but it would be preferable to handle this before that time.</p>

<p>Our current thought is to simply attach a version number onto the name of the JavaScript files and then when changes are made, increment the version on the script and update all references.  This definitely gets the job done, but updating the references on each release could get cumbersome.</p>

<p>As I'm sure we're not the first ones to deal with this, I figured I would throw it out to the community.  How are you ensuring clients update their cache when you update your code?  If you're using the method described above, are you using a process that simplifies the change?</p>

"<p>I have a coworker who writes unit tests for objects which fill their fields with random data. His reason is that it gives a wider range of testing, since it will test a lot of different values, whereas a normal test only uses a single static value.</p>

<ul>
<li>random values means the test isn't truly repeatable (which also means that if the test can randomly fail, it can do so on the build server and break the build)</li>
<li>if it's a random value and the test fails, we need to a) fix the object and b) force ourselves to test for that value every time, so we know it works, but since it's random we don't know what the value was</li>

"<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Last year, I did an internship in a physics research group at a university. In this group, we mostly used <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LabVIEW"">LabVIEW</a> to write programs for controlling our setups, doing data acquisition and analyzing our data. For the first two purposes, that works quite OK, but for data analysis, it's a real pain. On top of that, everyone was mostly self-taught, so code that was written was generally quite a mess (no wonder that every PhD quickly decided to rewrite everything from scratch). Version control was unknown, and impossible to set up because of strict software and network regulations from the IT department.</p>

<p>Now, things actually worked out surprisingly OK, but how do people in the natural sciences do their software development?</p>

<h3>Questions</h3>

<p>Some concrete questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What languages/environments have you used for developing scientific software, especially data analysis? What libraries? (for example, what do you use for plotting?)</li>
<li>Was there any training for people without any significant background in programming?</li>
<li>Did you have anything like version control, and bug tracking?</li>
<li>How would you go about trying to create a decent environment for programming, without getting too much in the way of the individual scientists (especially physicists are stubborn people!)</li>

"<p>A couple of years ago, ZDNet <a href=""http://blogs.zdnet.com/Burnette/?p=192"">ran an article</a> interviewing  Greg Stein  on the Google Code project, discussing several software licenses and why Google Code only accepts a few of them.

<p>With relevance to the question I'm about to ask, here's the money quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That is one of the reasons that Google chooses the Apache License (2.0) as the default for the software it open-sources. It is permissive like BSD, but (unlike BSD) actually happens to mention the rights under copyright law and gives you a license under those rights. In other words, it actually knows what it is doing unlike some of the other permissive licenses.</p>

<p>I like what you're saying, Adam, which is why I accepted your answer.

<p>I <em>could</em> use the git submodule system, but it doesn't act how I want it too (submodules are pointers to other repositories, and don't really contain the actual code, so it's useless for backup)</p>

"<p>How do you find a memory leak in Java (using, for example, JHat)? I have tried to load the heap dump up in JHat to take a basic look. However, I do not understand how I am supposed to be able to find the root reference (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/104/anatomy-of-a-memory-leak"">ref</a>) or whatever it is called. Basically, I can tell that there are several hundred megabytes of hash table entries ([java.util.HashMap$Entry or something like that), but maps are used all over the place... Is there some way to search for large maps, or perhaps find general roots of large object trees?</p>

<p>[Edit]
Ok, I've read the answers so far but let's just say I am a cheap bastard (meaning I am more interested in learning how to use JHat than to pay for JProfiler). Also, JHat is always available since it is part of the JDK. Unless of course there is no way with JHat but brute force, but I can't believe that can be the case.</p>

<p>Also, I do not think I will be able to actually modify (adding logging of <em>all</em> map sizes) and run it for long enough for me to notice the leak.</p>

<p>My guess is that the second option is faster, since it'll come back with a result as soon as it sees the first item, whereas the second option (for an IEnumerable) will need to visit every item to return the count.</p>

"<p>This past summer I was developing a basic ASP.NET/SQL Server CRUD app, and unit testing was one of the requirements.  I ran into some trouble when I tried to test against the database.  To my understanding, unit tests should be:</p>

<ul>
<li>stateless</li>
<li>independent from each other</li>
<li>repeatable with the same results i.e. no persisting changes</li>
</ul>

<p>These requirements seem to be at odds with each other when developing for a database.  For example, I can't test Insert() without making sure the rows to be inserted aren't there yet, thus I need to call the Delete() first.  But, what if they aren't already there?  Then I would need to call the Exists() function first.</p>

<p>My eventual solution involved very large setup functions (yuck!) and an empty test case which would run first and indicate that the setup ran without problems.  This is sacrificing on the independence of the tests while maintaining their statelessness.</p>

<p>Another solution I found is to wrap the function calls in a transaction which can be easily rolled back, like <a href=""http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/archive/2004/10/05/238201.aspx"">Roy Osherove's XtUnit</a>.  This work, but it involves another library, another dependency, and it seems a little too heavy of a solution for the problem at hand.</p>

<p>So, what has the SO community done when confronted with this situation?</p>

<hr>

<p>tgmdbm said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You typically use your favourite
  automated unit testing framework to
  perform integration tests, which is
  why some people get confused, but they
  don't follow the same rules. You are
  allowed to involve the concrete
  implementation of many of your classes
  (because they've been unit tested).
  You are testing <strong>how your concrete
  classes interact with each other and
  with the database</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if I read this correctly, there is really no way to <em>effectively</em> unit-test a Data Access Layer.  Or, would a ""unit test"" of a Data Access Layer involve testing, say, the SQL/commands generated by the classes, independent of actual interaction with the database?</p>

However, I guess I kind of know the general concensus is to <em>just do it</em> , However, I seem to have the following problems getting my head into the game:</p>

<ul>
<li>When working with collections, do will still test for obvious add/remove/inserts successful, even when based on Generics etc where we kind of ""know"" its going to work?</li>
<li>Some tests seem to take forever to implement.. Such as when working with string output, is there a ""better"" way to go about this sort of thing? (e.g. test the object model before parsing, break parsing down into small ops and test there) In my mind you should always test the ""end result"" but that can vary wildly and be tedious to set up.</li>
<li>I don't have a testing framework to use (work wont pay for one) so I can ""practice"" more. Are there any good ones that are free for commercial use? (at the moment I am using good 'ol <em>Debug.Assert</em> :)</li>
<li>Probably the biggest.. Sometimes I don't know what to expect <em>NOT</em> to happen.. I mean, you get your green light but I am always concerned that I may be missing a test.. Do you dig deeper to try and break the code, or leave it be and wait for it all fall over later (which will cost more)..</li>

"<p>We have a requirement in project to store all the revisions(Change History) for the entities in the database. Currently we have 2 designed proposals for this:</p>

<p>e.g. for ""Employee"" Entity</p>

<p><strong>Design 1:</strong></p>

<pre><code>-- Holds Employee Entity
""Employees (EmployeeId, FirstName, LastName, DepartmentId, .., ..)""

-- Holds the Employee Revisions in Xml. The RevisionXML will contain
-- all data of that particular EmployeeId
""EmployeeHistories (EmployeeId, DateModified, RevisionXML)""
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Design 2:</strong></p>

<pre><code>-- Holds Employee Entity
""Employees (EmployeeId, FirstName, LastName, DepartmentId, .., ..)""

-- In this approach we have basically duplicated all the fields on Employees 
-- in the EmployeeHistories and storing the revision data.
""EmployeeHistories (EmployeeId, RevisionId, DateModified, FirstName, 
      LastName, DepartmentId, .., ..)""
</code></pre>

<p>Is there any other way of doing this thing? </p>

<p>The problem with the ""Design 1"" is that we have to parse XML each time when you need to access data. This will slow the process and also add some limitations like we cannot add joins on the revisions data fields.</p>

<p>And the problem with the ""Design 2"" is that we have to duplicate each and every field on all entities (We have around 70-80 entities for which we want to maintain revisions).</p>

"<p>I'm thinking about making a networked game.  I'm a little new to this, and have already run into a lot of issues trying to put together a good plan for dead reckoning and network latency, so I'd love to see some good literature on the topic.  I'll describe the methods I've considered.</p>

<p>Originally, I just sent the player's input to the server, simulated there, and broadcast changes in the game state to all players.  This made cheating difficult, but under high latency things were a little difficult to control, since you dont see the results of your own actions immediately.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.gamasutra.com/features/19970919/aronson_01.htm"">This GamaSutra article</a> has a solution that saves bandwidth and makes local input appear smooth by simulating on the client as well, but it seems to throw cheat-proofing out the window.  Also, I'm not sure what to do when players start manipulating the environment, pushing rocks and the like.  These previously neutral objects would temporarily become objects the client needs to send PDUs about, or perhaps multiple players do at once.  Whose PDUs would win?  When would the objects stop being doubly tracked by each player (to compare with the dead reckoned version)?  Heaven forbid two players engage in a sumo match (e.g. start pushing each other).</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article1370.asp"">This gamedev.net bit</a> shows the gamasutra solution as inadequate, but describes a different method that doesn't really fix my collaborative boulder-pushing example.

"<p>We have a large database on which we have DB side pagination. This is quick, returning a page of 50 rows from millions of records in a small fraction of a second.</p>

<p>Users can define their own sort, basically choosing what column to sort by.  Columns are dynamic - some have numeric values, some dates and some text.</p>

<p>While most sort as expected text sorts in a dumb way. Well, I say dumb, it makes sense to computers, but frustrates users.</p>

rec10
rec14
rec2
rec20
rec3
rec4

rec2
rec3
rec4
rec10
rec14
rec20
</code></pre>

<p>I know a few ways to do this in C#, but can't pull down all the records to sort them, as that would be to slow.</p>

<p>Does anyone know a way to quickly apply a natural sort in Sql server?</p>

<hr>

<p>We're using:</p>

<pre><code>ROW_NUMBER() over (order by {field name} asc)
</code></pre>

<p>And then we're paging by that.</p>

<p>We can add triggers, although we wouldn't. All their input is parametrised and the like, but I can't change the format - if they put in ""rec2"" and ""rec10"" they expect them to be returned just like that, and in natural order.</p>

<hr>

<p>We have valid user input that follows different formats for different clients.</p>

<p>One might go rec1, rec2, rec3, ... rec100, rec101</p>

<p>While another might go: grp1rec1, grp1rec2, ... grp20rec300, grp20rec301</p>

<p>When I say we can't control the input I mean that we can't force users to change these standards - they have a value like grp1rec1 and I can't reformat it as grp01rec001, as that would be changing something used for lookups and linking to external systems.</p>

<p>These formats vary a lot, but are often mixtures of letters and numbers.</p>

<p>Sorting these in C# is easy - just break it up into <code>{ ""grp"", 20, ""rec"", 301 }</code> and then compare sequence values in turn.</p>

<p>However there may be millions of records and the data is paged, I need the sort to be done on the SQL server.</p>

<p>SQL server sorts by value, not comparison - in C# I can split the values out to compare, but in SQL I need some logic that (very quickly) gets a single value that consistently sorts.</p>

<p>@moebius - your answer might work, but it does feel like an ugly compromise to add a sort-key for all these text values.</p>

"<p>It seems that everybody is jumping on the dynamic, non-compiled bandwagon lately.  I've mostly only worked in compiled, static typed languages (C, Java, .Net).  The experience I have with dynamic languages is stuff like ASP (Vb Script), JavaScript, and PHP.  Using these technologies has left a bad taste in my mouth when thinking about dynamic languages.  Things that usually would have been caught by the compiler such as misspelled variable names and assigning an value of the wrong type to a variable don't occur until runtime.  And even then, you may not notice an error, as it just creates a new variable, and assigns some default value.  I've also never seen intellisense work well in a dynamic language, since, well, variables don't have any explicit type.</p>

<p>What I want to know is, what people find so appealing about dynamic languages?  What are the main advantages in terms of things that dynamic languages allow you to do that can't be done, or are difficult to do in compiled languages.  It seems to me that we decided a long time ago, that things like uncompiled asp pages throwing runtime exceptions was a bad idea. Why is there is a resurgence of this type of code?

"<p>What would be your preferred way to concatenate strings from a sequence such that between each two consecutive pair a comma is added. That is, how do you map, for instance, <code>[ 'a', 'b', 'c' ]</code> to <code>'a,b,c'</code>? (The cases <code>[ s ]</code> and <code>[]</code> should be mapped to <code>s</code> and <code>''</code>, respectively.)</p>

<p>I usually end up using something like <code>''.join(map(lambda x: x+',',l))[:-1]</code>, but also feeling somewhat unsatisfied.</p>

<p>Edit: I'm both ashamed and happy that the solution is so simple. Obviously I have hardly a clue as to what I'm doing. (I probably needed ""simple"" concatenation in the past and somehow memorised <code>s.join([e1,e2,...])</code> as a shorthand for <code>s+e1+e2+...</code>.)</p>

"<p>For my day job, I live in Emacs.  Utterly.  I also have become pretty dependent on CScope to help me find things in the code.</p>

When you do a CScope search and select a result, it automatically updates the right-side window to show the buffer referred to by the result.  This is all well and good, except that it causes me to lose my place in some other buffer that I was studying.  Sometimes this is no biggie, because [C-s u] gets me back to where I was.</p>

"<p>I'm considering using Django for a project I'm starting (fyi, a browser-based game) and one of the features I'm liking the most is using <code>syncdb</code> to automatically create the database tables based on the Django models I define (a feature that I can't seem to find in any other framework).
I was already thinking this was too good to be true when I saw this in the <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/django-admin/"">documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Syncdb will not alter existing tables</p>
  
  <p>syncdb will only create tables for models which have not yet been installed. It will never issue ALTER TABLE statements to match changes made to a model class after installation. Changes to model classes and database schemas often involve some form of ambiguity and, in those cases, Django would have to guess at the correct changes to make. There is a risk that critical data would be lost in the process.</p>
  
  <p>If you have made changes to a model and wish to alter the database tables to match, use the sql command to display the new SQL structure and compare that to your existing table schema to work out the changes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems that altering existing tables will have to be done ""by hand"".</p>

<p>What I would like to know is the best way to do this. Two solutions come to mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>As the documentation suggests, make the changes manually in the DB;</li>
<li>Do a backup of the database, wipe it, create the tables again (with syncdb, since now it's creating the tables from scratch) and import the backed-up data (this might take too long if the database is big)</li>

"<p>After discussion with colleagues regarding the use of the 'var' keyword in C# 3 I wondered what people's opinions were on the appropriate uses of type inference via var?</p>

<p>For example I rather lazily used var in questionable circumstances, e.g.:-</p>

<pre><code>foreach(var item in someList) { // ... } // Type of 'item' not clear.
var something = someObject.SomeProperty; // Type of 'something' not clear.
var something = someMethod(); // Type of 'something' not clear.
</code></pre>

<p>More legitimate uses of var are as follows:-</p>

<pre><code>var l = new List&lt;string&gt;(); // Obvious what l will be.
var s = new SomeClass(); // Obvious what s will be.
</code></pre>

<p>Interestingly LINQ seems to be a bit of a grey area, e.g.:-</p>

<pre><code>var results = from r in dataContext.SomeTable
              select r; // Not *entirely clear* what results will be here.
</code></pre>

<p>It's clear what results will be in that it will be a type which implements IEnumerable, however it isn't entirely obvious in the same way a var declaring a new object is.</p>

<p>It's even worse when it comes to LINQ to objects, e.g.:-</p>

<pre><code>var results = from item in someList
              where item != 3
              select item;
</code></pre>

<p>This is no better than the equivilent foreach(var item in someList) { // ... } equivilent.</p>

<p>There is a real concern about type safety here - for example if we were to place the results of that query into an overloaded method that accepted IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; and IEnumerable&lt;double&gt; the caller might inadvertently pass in the wrong type.</p>

<p><code>var</code> <em>does</em> maintain strong typing but the question is really whether it's dangerous for the type to not be immediately apparent on definition, something which is magnified when overloads mean compiler errors might not be issued when you unintentionally pass the wrong type to a method.</p>

<p>@Gaius,</p>

<p>That is the question that a database designer needs to weigh--what is the probable stability of the database structure?  Given a long-enough horizon nothing is stable. Or to say the converse, given a long-enough horizon, everything is subject to change.  A surrogate key (in theory) should never change its meaning because it never had meaning to begin with.  </p>

<p>I guess the other thing to consider in that particular design scenario is who is it that will be seeing the primary key?  If the primary key is something that end-users will actually need to refer to then it makes sense to make it something they can understand.  But I can't think of many cases where an end-user needs to see a primary key; usually the primary key is present to allow the DB engine to speed up certain operations.</p>

<p>My original thought in asking the question was to find design patterns for database design that were codified by more experienced database designers than myself so as to, hopefully, avoid some easily avoidable errors.  It would be interesting reading if anyone had ever codified database design anti-patterns. </p>

"<p>I'm working on a project using the <a href=""http://antlr.org"">ANTLR</a> parser library for C#.  I've built a grammar to parse some text and it works well.  However, when the parser comes across an illegal or unexpected token, it throws one of many exceptions.  The problem is that in some cases (not all) that my try/catch block won't catch it and instead stops execution as an unhandled exception.</p>

<p>The issue for me is that I can't replicate this issue anywhere else but in my full code.  The call stack shows that the exception definitely occurs within my try/catch(Exception) block.  The only thing I can think of is that there are a few ANTLR assembly calls that occur between my code and the code throwing the exception and this library does not have debugging enabled, so I can't step through it.  I wonder if non-debuggable assemblies inhibit exception bubbling?  The call stack looks like this; external assembly calls are in Antlr.Runtime:</p>

<pre>
    Expl.Itinerary.dll!TimeDefLexer.mTokens() Line 1213 C#
    Antlr3.Runtime.dll!Antlr.Runtime.Lexer.NextToken() + 0xfc bytes 
    Antlr3.Runtime.dll!Antlr.Runtime.CommonTokenStream.FillBuffer() + 0x22c bytes   
    Antlr3.Runtime.dll!Antlr.Runtime.CommonTokenStream.LT(int k = 1) + 0x68 bytes
    Expl.Itinerary.dll!TimeDefParser.prog() Line 109 + 0x17 bytes   C#
    Expl.Itinerary.dll!Expl.Itinerary.TDLParser.Parse(string Text = """", Expl.Itinerary.IItinerary Itinerary = {Expl.Itinerary.MemoryItinerary}) Line 17 + 0xa bytes C#
</pre>

<p>The code snippet from the bottom-most call in Parse() looks like:</p>

<pre><code>     try {
        // Execution stopped at parser.prog()
        TimeDefParser.prog_return prog_ret = parser.prog();
        return prog_ret == null ? null : prog_ret.value;
     }
     catch (Exception ex) {
        throw new ParserException(ex.Message, ex);
     }
</code></pre>

<p>To me, a catch (Exception) clause should've captured any exception whatsoever.  Is there any reason why it wouldn't?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I traced through the external assembly with Reflector and found no evidence of threading whatsoever.  The assembly seems to just be a runtime utility class for ANTLR's generated code.  The exception thrown is from the TimeDefLexer.mTokens() method and its type is NoViableAltException, which derives from RecognitionException -> Exception.  This exception is thrown when the lexer cannot understand the next token in the stream; in other words, invalid input.  This exception is SUPPOSED to happen, however it should've been caught by my try/catch block.</p>

<p>Also, the rethrowing of ParserException is really irrelevant to this situation.  That is a layer of abstraction that takes any exception during parse and convert to my own ParserException.  The exception handling problem I'm experiencing is never reaching that line of code.  In fact, I commented out the ""throw new ParserException"" portion and still received the same result.</p>

<p>One more thing, I modified the original try/catch block in question to instead catch NoViableAltException, eliminating any inheritance confusion.  I still received the same result.</p>

<p>Someone once suggested that sometimes VS is overactive on catching handled exceptions when in debug mode, but this issue also happens in release mode.</p>

<p>Man, I'm still stumped!  I hadn't mentioned it before, but I'm running VS 2008 and all my code is 3.5.  The external assembly is 2.0.  Also, some of my code subclasses a class in the 2.0 assembly.  Could a version mismatch cause this issue?</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> I was able to eliminate the .NET version conflict by porting relevant portions of my .NET 3.5 code to a .NET 2.0 project and replicate the same scenario.  I was able to replicate the same unhandled exception when running consistently in .NET 2.0.</p>

<p>I learned that ANTLR has recently released 3.1.  So, I upgraded from 3.0.1 and retried.  It turns out the generated code is a little refactored, but the same unhandled exception occurs in my test cases.</p>

<p><strong>Update 3:</strong>
I've replicated this scenario in a <a href=""http://www.explodingcoder.com/cms/files/TestAntlr-3.1.zip"">simplified VS 2008 project</a>.  Feel free to download and inspect the project for yourself.  I've applied all the great suggestions, but have not been able to overcome this obstacle yet.</p>

<p>If you can find a workaround, please do share your findings.  Thanks again!</p>

<hr>

<p>Thank you, but VS 2008 automatically breaks on unhandled exceptions.  Also, I don't have a Debug->Exceptions dialog.  The NoViableAltException that is thrown is fully intended, and designed to be caught by user code.  Since it is not caught as expected, program execution halts unexpectedly as an unhandled exception.</p>

<p>The exception thrown is derived from Exception and there is no multi-threading going on with ANTLR.</p>

"<p>We have an InnoDB database that is about 70 GB and we expect it to grow to several hundred GB in the next 2 to 3 years. About 60 % of the data belong to a single table. Currently the database is working quite well as we have a server with 64 GB of RAM, so almost the whole database fits into memory, but we’re concerned about the future when the amount of data will be considerably larger. Right now we’re considering some way of splitting up the tables (especially the one that accounts for the biggest part of the data) and I’m now wondering, what would be the best way to do it.</p>

<p>The options I’m currently aware of are</p>

<ul>
<li>Using MySQL Partitioning that comes with version 5.1 </li>
<li>Using some kind of third party library that encapsulates the partitioning of the data (like hibernate shards)</li>
<li>Implementing it ourselves inside our application</li>
</ul>

<p>Our application is built on J2EE and EJB 2.1 (hopefully we’re switching to EJB 3 some day).</p>

<p>What would you suggest?</p>

<p>EDIT (2011-02-11):<br>
Just an update: Currently the size of the database is 380 GB, the data size of our ""big"" table is 220 GB and the size of its index is 36 GB. So while the whole table does not fit in memory any more, the index does.<br>
The system is still performing fine (still on the same hardware) and we're still thinking about partitioning the data.</p>

<p>EDIT (2014-06-04):
One more update: The size of the whole database is 1.5 TB, the size of our ""big"" table is 1.1 TB. We upgraded our server to a 4 processor machine (Intel Xeon E7450) with 128 GB RAM.
The system is still performing fine.
What we're planning to do next is putting our big table on a separate database server (we've already done the necessary changes in our software) while simultaneously upgrading to new hardware with 256 GB RAM.</p>

<p>This setup is supposed to last for two years. Then we will either have to finally start implementing a sharding solution or just buy servers with 1 TB of RAM which should keep us going for some time. </p>

"<p>As one of those people that never got around to properly learning design (or having no talent for it), the design seems to be the step always holding me back. It's not a problem for rich-clients, as the standard GUI toolkits provide some acceptable ways to design a good-looking interface, but the web is another story. </p>

<p>Question: Does anyone know of a high-quality framework for designing the interface of web applications? I'm thinking of standard snippets of html for an adequate set of controls (the standard html controls plus maybe navigations, lists, forms) and style sheets to give it an acceptable, modern look. If such a thing existed, it could even support themes in the way wordpress, drupal etc. allow it.</p>

"<p>Using core jQuery, how do you remove all the options of a select box, then add one option and select it?</p>

<p>My select box is the following.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Select id=""mySelect"" size=""9"" &lt;/Select&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: The following code was helpful with chaining. However, (in Internet&nbsp;Explorer) <code>.val('whatever')</code> did not select the option that was added. (I did use the same 'value' in both <code>.append</code> and <code>.val</code>.)</p>

<pre><code>$('#mySelect').find('option').remove().end().append('&lt;option value=""whatever""&gt;text&lt;/option&gt;').val('whatever');
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: Trying to get it to mimic this code, I use the following code whenever the page/form is reset. This select box is populated by a set of radio buttons. <code>.focus()</code> was closer, but the option did not appear selected like it does with <code>.selected= ""true""</code>. Nothing is wrong with my existing code - I am just trying to learn jQuery.</p>

<pre><code>var mySelect = document.getElementById('mySelect');
mySelect.options.length = 0;
mySelect.options[0] = new Option (""Foo (only choice)"", ""Foo"");
mySelect.options[0].selected=""true"";
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: selected answer was close to what I needed. This worked for me:</p>

<pre><code>$('#mySelect').children().remove().end().append('&lt;option selected value=""whatever""&gt;text&lt;/option&gt;') ;

"<p>Has anyone found a useful solution to the DesignMode problem when developing controls?</p>

<p>The issue is that if you nest controls then DesignMode only works for the first level.  The second and lower levels DesignMode will always return FALSE.</p>

<p>The standard hack has been to look at the name of the process that is running and if it is ""DevEnv.EXE"" then it must be studio thus DesignMode is really TRUE.</p>

<p>The problem with that is looking for the ProcessName works its way around through the registry and other strange parts with the end result that the user might not have the required rights to see the process name.  In addition this strange route is very slow.  So we have had to pile additional hacks to use a singleton and if an error is thrown when asking for the process name then assume that DesignMode is FALSE.</p>

<p>A nice clean way to determine DesignMode is in order.  Acually getting Microsoft to fix it internally to the framework would be even better!</p>

If the string matches one of the strings in search-list - we need to do some further processing of the thing (which is also irrelevant).</p>

"<p>So, I did search google and SO prior to asking this question. Basically I have a DLL that has a form compiled into it. The form will be used to display information to the screen. Eventually it will be asynchronous and expose a lot of customization in the dll. For now I just want it to display properly. The problem that I am having is that I use the dll by loading it in a Powershell session. So when I try to display the form and get it to come to the top and have focus, It has no problem with displaying over all the other apps, but I can't for the life of me get it to display over the Powershell window. Here is the code that I am currently using to try and get it to display. I am sure that the majority of it won't be required once I figure it out, this just represents all the things that I found via google.</p>

<p>As I say I'm sure that most of that is either not needed or even flat out wrong, I just wanted to show the things that I had tried. Also, as I mentioned, I plan to have this be asynchronously displayed at some point which I suspect will wind up requiring a separate thread. Would splitting the form out into it's own thread make it easier to cause it to get focus over the Powershell session? </p>

msgFrm.BringToFront();
msgFrm.Focus();

<hr>

<p>Ok, threading it took care of the problem. @Quarrelsome, I did try both of those. Neither (nor both together) worked. I am curious as to what is evil about using threading? I am not using Application.Run and I have yet to have a problem. I am using a mediator class that both the parent thread and the child thread have access to. In that object I am using a ReaderWriterLock to lock one property that represents the message that I want displayed on the form that the child thread creates. The parent locks the property then writes what should be displayed. The child thread locks the property and reads what it should change the label on the form to. The child has to do this on a polling interval (I default it to 500ms) which I'm not real happy about, but I could not find an event driven way to let the child thread know that the proerty had changed, so I'm stuck with polling.</p>

  title ""<em>The goto statement considered
  harmful</em>"", which in later years would
  be most frequently referenced,
  regrettably, however, often by authors
  who had seen no more of it than its
  title, which became a cornerstone of
  my fame by becoming a template: we
  would see all sorts of articles under
  the title ""X considered harmful"" for
  almost any X, including one titled
  ""Dijkstra considered harmful"". But
  what had happened? I had submitted a
  paper under the title ""<strong><em>A case against
  the goto statement</em></strong>"", which, in order
  to speed up its publication, the
  editor had changed into a ""letter to
  the Editor"", and in the process he had
  given it a new title of his own
  invention! The editor was Niklaus
  Wirth.</p>

  view I am not in fact disagreeing

User has all of the same data as <code>Person</code> and potentially <code>SpecialPerson</code>, along with a user name and password as they are registered with the site.</p>

<hr>

<p>How would you address this problem? Would you have a <code>Person</code> table which stores all data common to a person and use a key to look up their data in <code>SpecialPerson</code> (if they are a special person) and User (if they are a user) and vice-versa?</p>

"<p>I started an application in Google App Engine right when it came out, to play with the technology and work on a pet project that I had been thinking about for a long time but never gotten around to starting.  The result is <a href=""http://www.bowlsk.com"">BowlSK</a>.  However, as it has grown, and features have been added, it has gotten really difficult to keep things organized - mainly due to the fact that this is my first python project, and I didn't know anything about it until I started working.</p>

<p>What I have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Main Level contains:
<ul>
<li>all .py files (didn't know how to make packages work)</li>
<li>all .html templates for main level pages</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Subdirectories:
<ul>
<li>separate folders for css, images, js, etc.</li>
<li>folders that hold .html templates for subdirecty-type urls</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Example:<br/>
<a href=""http://www.bowlsk.com/"">http://www.bowlsk.com/</a> maps to HomePage (default package), template at ""index.html""<br/>
<a href=""http://www.bowlsk.com/games/view-series.html?series=7130"">http://www.bowlsk.com/games/view-series.html?series=7130</a> maps to ViewSeriesPage (again, default package), template at ""games/view-series.html""</p>

<p>It's nasty.  How do I restructure?  I had 2 ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Main Folder containing: appdef, indexes, main.py?</p>

<ul>
<li>Subfolder for code.  Does this have to be my first package?</li>
<li>Subfolder for templates.  Folder heirarchy would match package heirarchy</li>
<li>Individual subfolders for css, images, js, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Main Folder containing appdef, indexes, main.py?</p>

<ul>
<li>Subfolder for code + templates.  This way I have the handler class right next to the template, because in this stage, I'm adding lots of features, so modifications to one mean modifications to the other.  Again, do I have to have this folder name be the first package name for my classes?  I'd like the folder to be ""src"", but I don't want my classes to be ""src.WhateverPage""</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Is there a best practice?  With Django 1.0 on the horizon, is there something I can do now to improve my ability to integrate with it when it becomes the official GAE templating engine?  I would simply start trying these things, and seeing which seems better, but pyDev's refactoring support doesn't seem to handle package moves very well, so it will likely be a non-trivial task to get all of this working again.</p>

<p>Ideally, the lookup of all items that are tagged with (at least) a set of n given tags should be done using a single SQL statement. Since the number of tags to search for as well as the number of tags on any item are unknown and may be high, using JOINs is impractical.</p>

"<p>I've been wondering, what is the point of clog? As near as I can tell, clog is the same as cerr but with buffering so it is more efficient. Usually stderr is the same as stdout, so clog is the same as cout. This seems pretty lame to me, so I figure I must be misunderstanding it. If I have log messages going out to the same place I have error messages going out to (perhaps something in /var/log/messages), then I probably am not writing too much out (so there isn't much lost by using non-buffered cerr). In my experience, I want my log messages up to date (not buffered) so I can help find a crash (so I don't want to be using the buffered clog). Apparently I should always be using cerr.</p>

<p>I'd like to be able to redirect clog inside my program. It would be useful to redirect cerr so that when I call a library routine I can control where cerr and clog go to.

Interchange plus billing means you only pay the processor what Visa/MC charges them, plus a flat fee.  (Amex and Discover charge their own rates directly to merchants, so this doesn't apply to those cards.  You'll find Amex rates to be in the 3% range and Discover could be as low as 1%.

"<p>We are getting very slow compile times, which can take upwards of 20+ minutes on dual core   2GHz, 2G Ram machines.</p>

<p>A lot of this is due to the size of our solution which has grown to 70+ projects, as well as VSS which is a bottle neck in itself when you have a lot of files. (swapping out VSS is not an option unfortunately, so I don't want this to descend into a VSS bash)</p>

<p>We are looking at merging projects.  We are also looking at having multiple solutions to achieve greater separation of concerns and quicker compile times for each element of the application. This I can see will become a DLL hell as we try to keep things in synch.</p>

<p>I am interested to know how other teams have dealt with this scaling issue, what do you do when your code base reaches a critical mass that you are wasting half the day watching the status bar deliver compile messages.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>
I neglected to mention this is a C# solution. Thanks for all the C++ suggestions, but it's been a few years since I've had to worry about headers.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>Nice suggestions that have helped so far (not saying there aren't other nice suggestions below, just what has helped)</p>

<ul>
<li>New 3GHz laptop - the power of lost utilization works wonders when whinging to management
<li>Disable Anti Virus during compile
<li>'Disconnecting' from VSS (actually the network) during compile - I may get us to remove VS-VSS integration altogether and stick to using the VSS UI
</ul>

<p>Still not rip-snorting through a compile, but every bit helps.</p>

<p>Orion did mention in a comment that generics may have a play also. From my tests there does appear to be a minimal performance hit, but not high enough to sure - compile times can be inconsistent due to disc activity. Due to time limitations, my tests didn't include as many Generics, or as much code, as would appear in live system, so that may accumulate. I wouldn't avoid using generics where they are supposed to be used, just for compile time performance</p>

<p><strong>WORKAROUND</strong></p>

<p>We are testing the practice of building new areas of the application in new solutions, importing in the latest dlls as required, them integrating them into the larger solution when we are happy with them.</p>

<p>We may also do them same to existing code by creating temporary solutions that just encapsulate the areas we need to work on, and throwing them away after reintegrating the code. We need to weigh up the time it will take to reintegrate this code against the time we gain by not having Rip Van Winkle like experiences with rapid recompiling during development.</p>

"<p>I would like to compare two collections (in C#), but I'm not sure of the best way to implement this efficiently.</p>

<p>I've read the other thread about <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43500/is-there-a-built-in-method-to-compare-collections-in-c"" rel=""nofollow"">Enumerable.SequenceEqual</a>, but it's not exactly what I'm looking for.</p>

<p>In my case, two collections would be equal if they both contain the same items (no matter the order).</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>collection1 = {1, 2, 3, 4};
collection2 = {2, 4, 1, 3};

collection1 == collection2; // true
</code></pre>

<p>What I usually do is to loop through each item of one collection and see if it exists in the other collection, then loop through each item of the other collection and see if it exists in the first collection. (I start by comparing the lengths).</p>

<pre><code>if (collection1.Count != collection2.Count)
    return false; // the collections are not equal

foreach (Item item in collection1)
{
    if (!collection2.Contains(item))
        return false; // the collections are not equal
}

foreach (Item item in collection2)
{
    if (!collection1.Contains(item))
        return false; // the collections are not equal
}

return true; // the collections are equal
</code></pre>

<p>However, this is not entirely correct, and it's probably not the most efficient way to do compare two collections for equality.</p>

<p>An example I can think of that would be wrong is:</p>

<pre><code>collection1 = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}
collection2 = {1, 2, 2, 3, 4}
</code></pre>

<p>Which would be equal with my implementation. Should I just count the number of times each item is found and make sure the counts are equal in both collections?</p>

<p>Summary from answers and links below:</p>

<ol>
<li>A pointer can be re-assigned any number of times while a reference can not be re-seated after binding. </li>
<li>Pointers can point nowhere (<code>NULL</code>), whereas reference always refer to an object.</li>
<li>You can't take the address of a reference like you can with pointers.</li>
<li>There's no ""reference arithmetics"" (but you can take the address of an object pointed by a reference and do pointer arithmetics on it as in <code>&amp;obj + 5</code>).</li>
</ol>

<p>To clarify a misconception:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The C++ standard is very careful to avoid dictating how a compiler must
  implement references, but every C++ compiler implements
  references as pointers. That is, a declaration such as:</em></p>

<pre><code>int &amp;ri = i;
</code></pre>
  
  <p><strong><em>if it's not optimized away entirely</em></strong>, <em>allocates the same amount of storage
  as a pointer, and places the address
  of i into that storage.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>So, a pointer and a reference both occupy the same amount of memory.</em></strong></p>

<p>As a general rule, </p>

<ul>
<li>Use references in function parameters and return types to define useful and self-documenting interfaces. </li>
<li>Use pointers to implement algorithms and data structures.</li>

"<p>I am trying to determine the best time efficient algorithm to accomplish the task described below.</p>

<p>I have a set of records. For this set of records I have connection data which indicates how pairs of records from this set connect to one another. This basically represents an undirected graph, with the records being the vertices and the connection data the edges.</p>

<p>All of the records in the set have connection information (i.e. no orphan records are present; each record in the set connects to one or more other records in the set).</p>

<p>I want to choose any two records from the set and be able to show all simple paths between the chosen records. By ""simple paths"" I mean the paths which do not have repeated records in the path (i.e. finite paths only).</p>

<p>Note: The two chosen records will always be different (i.e. start and end vertex will never be the same; no cycles).</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre>
    If I have the following records:
        A, B, C, D, E

    and the following represents the connections: 
        (A,B),(A,C),(B,A),(B,D),(B,E),(B,F),(C,A),(C,E),
        (C,F),(D,B),(E,C),(E,F),(F,B),(F,C),(F,E)

        [where (A,B) means record A connects to record B]
</pre>

      B->F->E
      B->F->C->E
      B->A->C->E

<li>MyDataService.svc &lt;- the one dealing with my data</li>
<li>AuthenticationService.svc &lt;- the one the windows app has to call to authenticate.</li>

<p>The Client Application Services is another alternative, but all the examples is limited to show how to get the user, roles and his profile...

"<p>Since our switch from Visual Studio 6 to Visual Studio 2008, we've been using the MFC90.dll and msvc[pr]90.dlls along with the manifest files in a private side-by-side configuration so as to not worry about versions or installing them to the system.</p>

<p>Pre-SP1, this was working fine (and still works fine on our developer machines). Now that we've done some testing post-SP1 I've been pulling my hair out since yesterday morning.</p>

<p>First off, our NSIS installer script pulls the dlls and manifest files from the redist folder. These were no longer correct, as the app still links to the RTM version.</p>

<p>So I added the define for <code>_BIND_TO_CURRENT_VCLIBS_VERSION=1</code> to all of our projects so that they will use the SP1 DLLs in the redist folder (or subsequent ones as new service packs come out). It took me hours to find this.</p>

<p>I've double checked the generated manifest files in the intermediate files folder from the compilation, and they correctly list the 9.0.30729.1 SP1 versions. I've double and triple checked depends on a clean machine: it all links to the local dlls with no errors. </p>

<p>Running the app still gets the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The application failed to initialize properly (0xc0150002). Click on OK to terminate the application.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>None of the searches I've done on google or microsoft have come up with anything that relates to my specific issues (but there are hits back to 2005 with this error message).</p>

<p>Any one had any similar problem with SP1?</p>

<p>Options:<ul>
<li>Find the problem and fix it so it works as it should (preferred)
<li>Install the redist
<li>dig out the old RTM dlls and manifest files and remove the #define to use the current ones. (I've got them in an earlier installer build, since Microsoft blasts them out of your redist folder!)</ul></p>

<p><b>Edit:</b> I've tried re-building with the define turned off (link to RTM dlls), and that works as long as the RTM dlls are installed in the folder. If the SP1 dlls are dropped in, it gets the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>c:\Program Files\...\...\X.exe</p>
  
  <p>This application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.</p>

"<p>While it would be very convenient to use inline functions at some situations,</p>

<p>Are there any drawbacks with inline functions?</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>:</p>

<p>Apparently, There is nothing wrong with using inline functions.</p>

<p>But it is worth noting the following points!</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Overuse of inlining can actually make programs slower. Depending on a function's size, inlining it can cause the code size to increase or decrease. Inlining a very small accessor function will usually decrease code size while inlining a very large function can dramatically increase code size. On modern processors smaller code usually runs faster due to better use of the instruction cache. <a href=""http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml#Inline_Functions"">- Google Guidelines</a></p></li>
<li><p>The speed benefits of inline functions tend to diminish as the function grows in size. At some point the overhead of the function call becomes small compared to the execution of the function body, and the benefit is lost <a href=""http://www-rocq.inria.fr/who/Marc.Thiriet/Langages/tic0324.html"">- Source</a></p></li>
<li><p>There are few situations where an inline function may not work:</p>

<ul>
<li>For a function returning values; if a return statement exists.</li>
<li>For a function not returning any values; if a loop, switch or goto statement exists. </li>
<li>If a function is recursive. <a href=""http://www-rocq.inria.fr/who/Marc.Thiriet/Langages/tic0324.html"">-Source</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The <code>__inline</code> keyword causes a function to be inlined only if you specify the optimize option. If optimize is specified, whether or not <code>__inline</code> is honored depends on the setting of the inline optimizer option. By default, the inline option is in effect whenever the optimizer is run. If you specify optimize , you must also specify the noinline option if you want the <code>__inline</code> keyword to be ignored. <a href=""http://support.sas.com/documentation/onlinedoc/sasc/doc750/html/clug/zcoptinl.htm"">-Source</a></p></li>

<p>Is there a time where the value looks like 0x0001FFFF that I should be worried about?  Certainly the larger the type, the more possible something like this is</p>

"<p>We've occasionally been getting problems whereby our long-running server processes (running on Windows Server 2003) have thrown an exception due to a memory allocation failure.  Our suspicion is these allocations are failing due to memory fragmentation.</p>

<p>Currently I have handlers for the ComboBox.SelectionChanged and ExampleClass.PropertyChanged events installed in my Window where I do the binding manually.</p>

<p>Is there a better or some kind of canonical way? Would you usually use Converters and how would you populate the ComboBox with the right values? I don't even want to get started with i18n right now.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>So one question was answered: How do I populate the ComboBox with the right values.</p>

<p>Retrieve Enum values as a list of strings via an ObjectDataProvider from the static Enum.GetValues method:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Window.Resources&gt;
    &lt;ObjectDataProvider MethodName=""GetValues""

"<p>I'm writing a little desktop app that should be able to encrypt a data file and protect it with a password (i.e. one must enter the correct password to decrypt).  I want the encrypted data file to be self-contained and portable, so the authentication has to be embedded in the file (or so I assume).</p>

<p>I have a strategy that appears workable and seems logical based on what I know (which is probably just enough to be dangerous), but I have no idea if it's actually a good design or not.  So tell me: is this crazy?  Is there a better/best way to do it?</p>

<ul>
<li>Step 1: User enters plain-text password, e.g. ""MyDifficultPassword""  </li>
<li>Step 2: App hashes the user-password and uses that value as the symmetric key to encrypt/decrypt the data file.  e.g. ""MyDifficultPassword"" --> ""HashedUserPwdAndKey"".  </li>
<li>Step 3: App hashes the hashed value from step 2 and saves the new value in the data file header (i.e. the unencrypted part of the data file) and uses that value to validate the user's password.  e.g. ""HashedUserPwdAndKey"" --> ""HashedValueForAuthentication""</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically I'm extrapolating from the common way to implement web-site passwords (when you're not using OpenID, that is), which is to store the (salted) hash of the user's password in your DB and never save the actual password.  But since I use the hashed user password for the symmetric encryption key, I can't use the same value for authentication.  So I hash it again, basically treating it just like another password, and save the doubly-hashed value in the data file.  That way, I can take the file to another PC and decrypt it by simply entering my password.</p>

<p>So is this design reasonably secure, or hopelessly naive, or somewhere in between?  Thanks!</p>

<p>EDIT: clarification and follow-up question re: Salt.<br />
I thought the salt had to be kept secret to be useful, but your answers and links imply this is not the case.  For example, <a href=""ftp://ftp.rsasecurity.com/pub/pkcs/pkcs-5v2/pkcs5v2-0.pdf"">this spec</a> linked by erickson (below) says: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thus, password-based key derivation as defined here is a function of a password, a salt, and an iteration count, where the latter two quantities need not be kept secret.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does this mean that I could store the salt value in the same place/file as the hashed key and still be more secure than if I used no salt at all when hashing?  How does that work?</p>

<p>A little more context: the encrypted file isn't meant to be shared with or decrypted by others, it's really single-user data.  But I'd like to deploy it in a shared environment on computers I don't fully control (e.g. at work) and be able to migrate/move the data by simply copying the file (so I can use it at home, on different workstations, etc.).</p>

"<p>Backgrounder:</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opaque_pointer"">PIMPL Idiom</a> (Pointer to IMPLementation) is a technique for implementation hiding in which a public class wraps a structure or class that cannot be seen outside the library the public class is part of.</p>

<p>This hides internal implementation details and data from the user of the library.</p>

"<p>What is the easiest way to compare strings in Python, ignoring case?</p>

<p>Of course one can do (str1.lower() &lt;= str2.lower()), etc., but this created two additional temporary strings (with the obvious alloc/g-c overheads).</p>

<p>I guess I'm looking for an equivalent to C's stricmp().</p>

<p>[Some more context requested, so I'll demonstrate with a trivial example:]</p>

<p>Suppose you want to sort a looong list of strings. You simply do theList.sort().
This is O(n * log(n)) string comparisons and no memory management (since all
strings and list elements are some sort of smart pointers). You are happy.</p>

<p>Now, you want to do the same, but ignore the case (let's simplify and say
all strings are ascii, so locale issues can be ignored).
You can do theList.sort(key=lambda s: s.lower()), but then you cause two new 
allocations per comparison, plus burden the garbage-collector with the duplicated
(lowered) strings. 
Each such memory-management noise is orders-of-magnitude slower than simple string comparison.</p>

<p>Now, with an in-place stricmp()-like function, you do: theList.sort(cmp=stricmp)
and it is as fast and as memory-friendly as theList.sort(). You are happy again.</p>

<p>The problem is any Python-based case-insensitive comparison involves implicit string 
duplications, so I was expecting to find a C-based comparisons (maybe in module string).</p>

<p>Could not find anything like that, hence the question here.

<p>Assume that you have a algorithm that generates randomness. Now how do you test it?
Or to be more direct - Assume you have an algorithm that shuffles a deck of cards, how do you test that it's a perfectly random algorithm?</p>

<p>To add some theory to the problem -
A deck of cards can be shuffled in 52! (52 factorial) different ways. Take a deck of cards, shuffle it by hand and write down the order of all cards. What is the probability that you would have gotten exactly that shuffle? Answer: 1 / 52!.</p>

<p>What is the chance that you, after shuffling, will get A, K, Q, J ... of each suit in a sequence? Answer 1 / 52!</p>

<p>So, just shuffling once and looking at the result will give you absolutely no information about your shuffling algorithms randomness. Twice and you have more information, Three even more...</p>

"<p>I know this sounds like a point-whoring question but let me explain where I'm coming from.</p>

<p>Out of college I got a job at a PHP shop.  I worked there for a year and a half and thought that I had learned all there was to learn about programming.</p>

<p>Then I got a job as a one-man internal development shop at a sizable corporation where all the work was in C#.  In my commitment to the position I started reading a ton of blogs and books and quickly realized how wrong I was to think I knew everything.  I learned about unit testing, dependency injection and decorator patterns, the design principle of loose coupling, the composition over inheritance debate, and so on and on and on - I am still very much absorbing it all.  Needless to say my programming style has changed entirely in the last year.</p>

<p>Now I find myself picking up a php project doing some coding for a friend's start-up and I feel completely constrained as opposed to programming in C#.  It really bothers me that all variables at a class scope have to be referred to by appending '$this->' .  It annoys me that none of the IDEs that I've tried have very good intellisense and that my SimpleTest unit tests methods have to start with the word 'test'.  It drives me crazy that dynamic typing keeps me from specifying implicitly which parameter type a method expects, and that you have to write a switch statement to do method overloads.  I can't stand that you can't have nested namespaces and have to use the :: operator to call the base class's constructor.</p>

<p>Now I have no intention of starting a PHP vs C# debate, rather what I mean to say is that I'm sure there are some PHP features that I either don't know about or know about yet fail to use properly.  I am set in my C# universe and having trouble seeing outside the glass bowl.</p>

"<p>Seems like there are so many different ways of automating one's build/deployment that it becomes difficult to parse through all the different scenarios that people support in tutorials on the web.

<li>Web Application Project</li>
<li>CruiseControl.NET</li>

<p>One of the first things I tried was to have CCnet automatically zip the output and copy it to the server, but then that requires manual work to unzip at the destination.  However, if we try to copy all the files individually, then it could potentially take a long time if it's a large application (build server lives outside of the datacenter in our office ... I know).</p>

<p>Also of particular interest is how we would support multiple environments as we have dev, qa, uat, and then of course prod.</p>

If anything, it seems like it'll be useful in deploying one build across a build farm ... but even for deploying from one environment to another, one would have to manually change config settings and web service URLs, etc.</p>

"<p>My motto for Java is ""just because Java has static blocks, it doesn't mean that you should be using them."" Jokes aside, there are a lot of tricks in Java that make testing a nightmare. Two of the most I hate are Anonymous Classes and Static Blocks. We have a lot of legacy code that make use of Static Blocks and these are one of the annoying points in our push in writing unit tests. Our goal is to be able to write unit tests for classes that depend on this static initialization with minimal code changes. </p>

<p>So far my suggestion to my colleagues is to move the body of the static block into a private static method and call it <code>staticInit</code>. This method can then be called from within the static block. For unit testing another class that depends on this class could easily mock <code>staticInit</code> with JMockit to not do anything. Let's see this in example.</p>

<pre><code>public class ClassWithStaticInit {
  static {
    System.out.println(""static initializer."");
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Will be changed to</p>

<pre><code>public class ClassWithStaticInit {
  static {
    staticInit();
  }

  private static void staticInit() {
    System.out.println(""static initialized."");
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So that we can do the following in a JUnit.</p>

<pre><code>public class DependentClassTest {
  public static class MockClassWithStaticInit {
    public static void staticInit() {
    }
  }

  @BeforeClass
  public static void setUpBeforeClass() {
    Mockit.redefineMethods(ClassWithStaticInit.class, MockClassWithStaticInit.class);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>However this solution also comes with its own problems. You can't run <code>DependentClassTest</code> and <code>ClassWithStaticInitTest</code> on the same JVM since you actually want the static block to run for <code>ClassWithStaticInitTest</code>.</p>

<p>What would be your way of accomplishing this task? Or any better, non-JMockit based solutions that you think would work cleaner?</p>

"<p>Currently my workflow with Emacs when I am coding in C or C++ involves three windows.  The largest on the right contains the file I am working with.  The left is split into two, the bottom being a shell which I use to type in compile or make commands, and the top is often some sort of documentation or README file that I want to consult while I am working.  Now I know there are some pretty expert Emacs users out there, and I am curious what other Emacs functionally is useful if the intention is to use it as a complete IDE.  Specifically, most IDEs usually fulfill these functions is some form or another:</p>

<ul>
<li>Source code editor</li>
<li>Compiler</li>
<li>Debugging</li>
<li>Documentation Lookup</li>
<li>Version Control</li>

This one uses shorter aliases:<br>

<p>Recode also supports <em>surfaces</em> which can be used to convert between different line ending types and encodings:</p>

<p>You can also combine them.</p>

>>> obj._MyClass__myPrivateMethod()
this is private!!

<p>What's the deal?!</p>

<p>I'll explain this a little for those who didn't quite get that.</p>

<pre><code>>>> class MyClass:
...     def myPublicMethod(self):
...             print 'public method'
...     def __myPrivateMethod(self):

<p>Everything looks good here; we're unable to call it. It is, in fact, 'private'. Well, actually it isn't. Running <em>dir()</em> on the object reveals a new magical method that python creates magically for all of your 'private' methods.</p>

"<p>The following code snippet (correctly) gives a warning in C and an error in C++ (using gcc &amp; g++ respectively, tested with versions 3.4.5 and 4.2.1; MSVC does not seem to care):</p>

<pre><code>char **a;
const char** b = a;
</code></pre>

<p>I can understand and accept this.<br>
The C++ solution to this problem is to change b to be a const char * const *, which disallows reassignment of the pointers and prevents you from circumventing const-correctness (<a href=""http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/const-correctness.html#faq-18.17"">C++ FAQ</a>).<br></p>

<pre><code>char **a;
const char* const* b = a;
</code></pre>

<p>However, in pure C, the corrected version (using const char * const *) still gives a warning, and I don't understand why.
Is there a way to get around this without using a cast?</p>

<p>To clarify:<br>
1) Why does this generate a warning in C?  It should be entirely const-safe, and the C++ compiler seems to recognize it as such.<br>
2) What is the correct way to go about accepting this char** as a parameter while saying (and having the compiler enforce) that I will not be modifying the characters it points to?
For example, if I wanted to write a function:</p>

<pre><code>void f(const char* const* in) {
  // Only reads the data from in, does not write to it
}
</code></pre>

<p>And I wanted to invoke it on a char**, what would be the correct type for the parameter?</p>

<li>libwww-perl</li>
<li>libwww for unix and C (while searching for libwww for perl I came across this, which I did not know existed until now)</li>
<li>a more ""general"" macro solution like AutoHotKey</li>
</ul>

<p>Has anyone here on Stack Overflow tried any of these solutions? If so, what did you like or dislike about them? Can anyone recommend one that is not on the list? (This is by no means an exclusive or exhaustive list).

<p>Fair enough, but is there a workaround to allow a Generic Enum, or am I going to have to mimic the Parse function and pass a type as an attribute, which forces the ugly boxing requirement to your code.</p>

As far as I can tell, it doesn't even check that the certificate claims to be for the hostname I'm connecting to.  That seems like a major security hole (especially with the recent DNS vulnerabilities).</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>  It turns out what I really wanted was <code>HTTPS_CA_DIR</code>, because I don't have a ca-bundle.crt.  But <code>HTTPS_CA_DIR=/usr/share/ca-certificates/</code> did the trick.  I'm marking the answer as accepted anyway, because it was close enough.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> It turns out that <code>HTTPS_CA_DIR</code> and <code>HTTPS_CA_FILE</code> only apply if you're using Net::SSL as the underlying SSL library.  But LWP also works with IO::Socket::SSL, which will ignore those environment variables and happily talk to any server, no matter what certificate it presents.  Is there a more general solution?</p>

<p><strong>Update 3:</strong> Unfortunately, the solution still isn't complete.  Neither Net::SSL nor IO::Socket::SSL is checking the host name against the certificate.  This means that someone can get a legitimate certificate for some domain, and then impersonate any other domain without LWP complaining.</p>

That's not a big deal since it's simpy a matter of extending the ProfileBase class.  After creating a ProfileCommon class, I wrote the following Action method for creating the user profile.</p>

<pre><code>[AcceptVerbs(""POST"")]
public ActionResult CreateProfile(string company, string phone, string fax, string city, string state, string zip)
{
    MembershipUser user = Membership.GetUser();
    ProfileCommon profile = ProfileCommon.Create(user.UserName, user.IsApproved) as ProfileCommon;

    profile.Company = company;
    profile.Phone = phone;
    profile.Fax = fax;
    profile.City = city;
    profile.State = state;
    profile.Zip = zip;
    profile.Save();

    return RedirectToAction(""Index"", ""Account""); 
}</code></pre>

<p>The problem that I'm having is that the call to ProfileCommon.Create() cannot cast to type ProfileCommon, so I'm not able to get back my profile object, which obviously causes the next line to fail since profile is null.</p>

<p>Following is a snippet of my web.config:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;profile defaultProvider=""AspNetSqlProfileProvider"" automaticSaveEnabled=""false"" enabled=""true""&gt;
    &lt;providers&gt;
        &lt;clear/&gt;
        &lt;add name=""AspNetSqlProfileProvider"" type=""System.Web.Profile.SqlProfileProvider, System.Web, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a"" connectionStringName=""ApplicationServices"" applicationName=""/"" /&gt;
    &lt;/providers&gt;
    &lt;properties&gt;
        &lt;add name=""FirstName"" type=""string"" /&gt;
        &lt;add name=""LastName"" type=""string"" /&gt;
        &lt;add name=""Company"" type=""string"" /&gt;
        &lt;add name=""Phone"" type=""string"" /&gt;
        &lt;add name=""Fax"" type=""string"" /&gt;
        &lt;add name=""City"" type=""string"" /&gt;
        &lt;add name=""State"" type=""string"" /&gt;
        &lt;add name=""Zip"" type=""string"" /&gt;
        &lt;add name=""Email"" type=""string"" &gt;
    &lt;/properties&gt;
&lt;/profile&gt;</pre></code>

The MembershipProvider is working without a hitch, so I know that the connection string is good.

<p>I am coding an rss reader and I believe I made the wrong choice in using xml over a sqlite database to store a cache of <em>all</em> the feeds items.

"<p>Visual Studio 2003 and 2005 (and perhaps 2008 for all I know) require the command line user to run in the 'Visual Studio Command Prompt'.  When starting this command prompt it sets various environment variables that the C++ compiler, cl, uses when compiling.</p>

<p>This is not always desirable.  If, for example, I want to run 'cl' from within Ant, I'd like to avoid having to run Ant from within the 'Visual Studio Command Prompt'.

"<p>I am looking for an easy way to check if an object in C# is serializable.</p>

<p>As we know you make an object serializable by either implementing the <em>ISerializable</em> interface or by placing the <em>[Serializable]</em> at the top of the class.</p>

<p>What I am looking for is a quick way to check this without having to reflect the class to get it's attributes. The interface would be quick using an <em>is</em> statement.</p>

{
    return ((obj is ISerializable) || (Attribute.IsDefined(typeof (T), typeof (SerializableAttribute))));

<pre><code>typeof(T).IsSerializable

<p>Remember though this this seems to only just the class that we are dealing with if the class contains other classes you probably want to check them all or try and serialize and wait for errors as @pb pointed out.</p>

"<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>I've always been searching for a way to make Visual Studio draw a line after a certain amount of characters.</p>

<p>Below is a guide to enable these so called <em>guidelines</em> for various versions of Visual Studio.</p>

<p><strong>Visual Studio 2013</strong></p>

<p>Install Paul Harrington's Editor Guidelines extension for <a href=""http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/da227a0b-0e31-4a11-8f6b-3a149cf2e459/view/Reviews"">VS 2013</a></p>

<p><strong>Visual Studio 2010 and 2012</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Install Paul Harrington's Editor Guidelines extension for <a href=""http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/0fbf2878-e678-4577-9fdb-9030389b338c"">VS 2010</a> or <a href=""http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/da227a0b-0e31-4a11-8f6b-3a149cf2e459?SRC=Home"">VS 2012</a>.</li>
<li>Open the registry at:
<br />VS 2010: <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\10.0\Text Editor</code>
<br />VS 2012: <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\11.0\Text Editor</code>
<br />and add a new string called <code>Guides</code> with the value <code>RGB(100,100,100), 80</code>. The 
first part specifies the color, while the other one (<code>80</code>) is the column the line will be displayed.</li>
<li>Or install the <a href=""http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/7f2a6727-2993-4c1d-8f58-ae24df14ea91"">Guidelines UI</a> extension (which is also a part of the <a href=""http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/d0d33361-18e2-46c0-8ff2-4adea1e34fef/"">Productivity Power Tools</a>), which will add entries to the editor's context menu for adding/removing the entries without needing to edit the registry directly. The current disadvantage of this method is that you can't specify the column directly.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Visual Studio 2008 and Other Versions</strong></p>

<p>If you are using Visual Studio 2008 open the registry at <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\9.0\Text Editor</code> and add a new string called <code>Guides</code> with the value <code>RGB(100,100,100), 80</code>. The first part specifies the color, while the other one (<code>80</code>) is the column the line will be displayed. The vertical line will appear, when you restart Visual Studio.</p>

<p>This trick also works for various other version of Visual Studio, as long as you use the correct path:</p>

<pre><code>2003: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\7.1\Text Editor
2005: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\8.0\Text Editor
2008: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\9.0\Text Editor
2008 Express: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VCExpress\9.0\Text Editor

<p>Faults come with built-in support from WCF where by you can use the built-in error handlers and react accordingly. This, however, carries overhead as throwing exceptions in .NET can be quite costly.</p>

<p>Messages can contain the necessary information to determine what happened with your service call without the overhead of throwing an exception. It does however need several lines of repetitive code to analyze the message and determine actions following its contents.</p>

<p>We took a stab at creating a generic message object we could utilize in our services, and this is what we came up with:</p>

<pre><code>public class ReturnItemDTO&lt;T&gt;
{
    [DataMember]
    public bool Success { get; set; }

    [DataMember]
    public string ErrorMessage { get; set; }

    [DataMember]
    public T Item { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If all my service calls return this item, I can consistently check the ""Success"" property to determine if all went well. I then have an error message string in the event indicating something went wrong, and a generic item containing a Dto if needed.</p>

<p>The exception information will have to be logged away to a central logging service and not passed back from the service.</p>

<p>Thoughts? Comments? Ideas? Suggestions?</p>

<p><strong>Some further clarification on my question</strong></p>

<p>An issue I'm having with fault contracts is communicating business rules.</p>

<p>Like, if someone logs in, and their account is locked, how do I communicate that? Their login obviously fails, but it fails due to the reason ""Account Locked"".</p>

<p>So do I:</p>

<p>A) use a boolean, throw Fault with message account locked</p>

<p>B) return AuthenticatedDTO with relevant information</p>

"<p>I'm building a group calendar application that needs to support recurring events, but all the solutions I've come up with to handle these events seem like a hack. I can limit how far ahead one can look, and then generate all the events at once.

"<p>Would it not make sense to support a set of languages (Java, Python, Ruby, etc.) by way of a standardized virtual machine hosted in the browser rather than requiring the use of a specialized language -- really, a specialized paradigm -- for client scripting only?</p>

<p>I understand the pragmatic reality that JavaScript is simply what we have to work with now due to evolutionary reasons, but I'm thinking more about the long term.

<li><p>A layout overhaul is easier without tables, see <a href=""http://csszengarden.com/"">css Zen Garden</a>.<br>Most web sites that need an upgrade need new content (HTML) as well.

"<p>I’ve been reading a few questions and answers regarding exceptions and their use. Seems to be a strong opinion that exceptions should be raised only for exception, unhandled cases. So that lead me to wondering how validation works with business objects.</p>

<p>Lets say I have a business object with getters/setters for the properties on the object. Let’s say I need to validate that the  value is between 10 and 20. This is a business rule so it belongs in my business object. So that seems to imply to me that the validation code goes in my setter. Now I have my UI databound to the properties of the data object. The user enters 5, so the rule needs to fail and the user is not allowed to move out of the textbox. . The UI is databound to the property so the setter is going to be called, rule checked and failed. If I raised an exception from my business object to say the rule failed, the UI would pick that up. But that seems to go against the preferred usage for exceptions. Given that it’s a setter, you aren’t really going to have a  ‘result’ for the setter. If I set another flag on the object then that would imply the UI has to check that flag after each UI interaction.</p>

<p>So how should the validation work?</p>

<p>Edit: I've probably used an over-simplified example here. Something like the range check above could be handled easily by the UI but what if the valdation was more complicated, e.g. the business object calculates a number based on the input and if that calculated number is out of range it should be recjected. This is more complicated logic that should not be in th UI. </p>

<p>There is also the consideration of further data entered based on a field already entered. e.g.I have to enter an item on the order to get certain informaion like stock on hand, current cost, etc. The user may require this information to make decisions on further entry (liek how many units to order) or it may be required in order for further validation to be done. Should a user be able to enter other fields if the item isn't valid? What would be the point?</p>

"<p>My web application has a login page that submits authentication credentials via an AJAX call. If the user enters the correct username and password, everything is fine, but if not, the following happens:</p>

<ol>
<li>The web server determines that although the request included a well-formed Authorization header, the credentials in the header do not successfully authenticate.</li>
<li>The web server returns a 401 status code and includes one or more WWW-Authenticate headers listing the supported authentication types.</li>
<li>The browser detects that the response to my call on the XMLHttpRequest object is a 401 and the response includes WWW-Authenticate headers. It then pops up an authentication dialog asking, again, for the username and password.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is all fine up until step 3. I don't want the dialog to pop up, I want want to handle the 401 response in my AJAX callback function. (For example, by displaying an error message on the login page.) I want the user to re-enter their username and password, of course, but I want them to see my friendly, reassuring login form, not the browser's ugly, default authentication dialog.</p>

<p>Incidentally, I have no control over the server, so having it return a custom status code (i.e., something other than a 401) is not an option.</p>

<p>Is there any way I can suppress the authentication dialog? In particular, can I suppress the Authentication Required dialog in Firefox 2 or later? Is there any way to suppress the Connect to <em>[host]</em> dialog in IE 6 and later?</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong><br />
<em>Additional information from the author (Sept. 18):</em><br />
I should add that the real problem with the browser's authentication dialog popping up is that it give insufficient information to the user.</p>

<p>The user has just entered a username and password via the form on the login page, he believes he has typed them both correctly, and he has clicked the submit button or hit enter. His expectation is that he will be taken to the next page or perhaps told that he has entered his information incorrectly and should try again. However, he is instead presented with an unexpected dialog box.</p>

<p>The dialog makes no acknowledgment of the fact he just <em>did</em> enter a username and password. It does not clearly state that there was a problem and that he should try again. Instead, the dialog box presents the user with cryptic information like ""The site says: '<em>[realm]</em>'."" Where <em>[realm]</em> is a short realm name that only a programmer could love.</p>

<p>Web broswer designers take note: no one would ask how to suppress the authentication dialog if the dialog itself were simply more user-friendly. The <em>entire</em> reason that I am doing a login form is that our product management team rightly considers the browsers' authentication dialogs to be awful.</p>

"<p>I'm asking for a template trick to detect if a class has a specific member function of a given signature.</p>

<p>The problem is similar to the one cited here
<a href=""http://www.gotw.ca/gotw/071.htm"">http://www.gotw.ca/gotw/071.htm</a>
but not the same: in the item of Sutter's book he answered to the question that a class C MUST PROVIDE  a member function with a particular signature, else the program won't compile. In my problem I need to do something if a class has that function, else do ""something else"". </p>

<p>A similar problem was faced by boost::serialization but I don't like the solution they adopted: a template function that invokes by default a free function (that you have to define) with a particular signature unless you define a particular member function (in their case ""serialize"" that takes 2 parameters of a given type) with a particular signature, else a compile error will happens. That is to implement both intrusive and non-intrusive serialization. </p>

<p>I don't like that solution for two reasons: 1) to be non intrusive you must override the global ""serialize"" function that is in boost::serialization namespace, so you have IN YOUR CLIENT CODE to open namespace boost and namespace serialization!! And a second, practical reason, is because the stack to resolve that mess was 10 to 12 function invocation... and I'm a game developer.</p>

<p>I need to define a custom behavior for classes that has not that member function, and my entities are inside different namespaces (and I don't want to override a global function defined in one namespace while I'm in another one)</p>

<p>Can you give me an hint to solve this puzzle?</p>

<p>EDIT:
@Chris Jester-Young
I know well Koenig lookup. In fact I was surprised of what they did in documentation (<a href=""http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_36_0/libs/serialization/doc/index.html"">http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_36_0/libs/serialization/doc/index.html</a>)</p>

<p>why open the boost::serialization namespace?</p>

<p>but you are not answering to my question: I don't want to do the same thing of boost::serialization. Maybe I decide to do ""nothing"" if the class has not that function with that signature. in boost::serialization if you don't have that member function OR if you don't override global ""serialize"" function... compile error! I don't want this.</p>

<p>EDIT: @Tom Leys
I'm sorry that's not what I expected as answer. What you suggest me is not what I want. If you read the link to the gotw site (old site of Herb Sutter) you'll discover that your solution is both intrusive (and I don't want) and it doesn't solve the problem with the signature and it doesn't solve the fact that I can accept classes that don't have that member function... It's a bit more tricky.</p>

<p>So I have read the thread <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11831/singletons-good-design-or-a-crutch"">Singletons: good design or a crutch?</a><br>
And the argument still rages.</p>

<p>I see Singletons as a Design Pattern (good and bad).<br><br>
The problem with Singleton is not the Pattern but rather the users (sorry everybody). Everybody and their father thinks they can implement one correctly (and from the many interviews I have done, most people can't). Also because everybody thinks they can implement a correct Singleton they abuse the Pattern and use it in situations that are not appropriate (replacing global variables with Singletons!).</p>

<p>So the main questions that need to be answered are:</p>

<ul>
<li>When should you use a Singleton</li>
<li>How do you implement a Singleton correctly</li>
</ul>

<p>My hope for this article is that we can collect together in a single place (rather than having to google and search multiple sites) an authoritative source of when (and then how) to use a Singleton correctly. Also appropriate would be a list of Anti-Usages and common bad implementations explaining why they fail to work and for good implementations their weaknesses.<br><br><hr></p>

I will hold my hand up and say this is what I use but probably has problems.<br>

"<p>I've always wondered this - why can't you declare variables after a case label in a switch statement?  In C++ you can declare variables pretty much anywhere (and declaring them close to first use is obviously a good thing) but the following still won't work:</p>

{  
case VAL:  
  // This won't work
  int newVal = 42;  
  break;
case ANOTHER_VAL:

"<p>I hope this question is not considered too basic for this forum, but we'll see. I'm wondering how to refactor some code for better performance that is getting run a bunch of times.</p>

<p>Say I'm creating a word frequency list, using a Map (probably a HashMap), where each key is a String with the word that's being counted and the value is an Integer that's incremented each time a token of the word is found.</p>

<p>In Perl, incrementing such a value would be trivially easy:</p>

<pre><code>$map{$word}++;
</code></pre>

<p>But in Java, it's much more complicated. Here the way I'm currently doing it:</p>

<pre><code>int count = map.containsKey(word) ? map.get(word) : 0;
map.put(word, count + 1);
</code></pre>

<p>Which of course relies on the autoboxing feature in the newer Java versions. I wonder if you can suggest a more efficient way of incrementing such a value. Are there even good performance reasons for eschewing the Collections framework and using a something else instead?</p>

<p>The entire height of the page is filled, and no scrolling is required.</p>

<p>For anything inside the content div, setting <code>top: 0;</code> will put it right underneath the header. Sometimes the content will be a real table, with it's height set to 100%. Putting <code>header</code> inside <code>content</code> will not allow this to work.</p>

<p>Is there a way to achieve the same effect without using the <code>table</code>?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>Elements inside the content <code>div</code> will have heights set to percentages as well. So something at 100% inside the <code>div</code> will fill it to the bottom. As will two elements at 50%.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong></p>

<p>For instance, if the header takes up 20% of the screen's height, a table specified at 50% inside <code>#content</code> would take up 40% of the screen space. So far, wrapping the entire thing in a table is the only thing that works.</p>

"<p>I've been working on this for a few days now, and I've found several solutions but none of them incredibly simple or lightweight.  The problem is basically this:  We have a cluster of 10 machines, each of which is running the same software on a multithreaded ESB platform. I can deal with concurrency issues between threads on the same machine fairly easily, but what about concurrency on the same data on different machines?  </p>

<p>Essentially the software receives requests to feed a customer's data from one business to another via web services.  However, the customer may or may not exist yet on the other system.  If it does not, we create it via a web service method.  So it requires a sort of test-and-set, but I need a semaphore of some sort to lock out the other machines from causing race conditions.  I've had situations before where a remote customer was created twice for a single local customer, which isn't really desirable.</p>

<p>Solutions I've toyed with conceptually are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Using our fault-tolerant shared file system to create ""lock"" files which will be checked for by each machine depending on the customer</p></li>
<li><p>Using a special table in our database, and locking the whole table in order to do a ""test-and-set"" for a lock record.</p></li>
<li><p>Using Terracotta, an open source server software which assists in scaling, but uses a hub-and-spoke model.</p></li>
<li><p>Using EHCache for synchronous replication of my in-memory ""locks.""</p></li>

"<p>In C# and in Java (and possibly other languages as well), variables declared in a ""try"" block are not in scope in the corresponding ""catch"" or ""finally"" blocks.  For example, the following code does not compile:</p>

<pre><code>try {
  String s = ""test"";
  // (more code...)
}
catch {
  Console.Out.WriteLine(s);  //Java fans: think ""System.out.println"" here instead
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this code, a compile-time error occurs on the reference to s in the catch block, because s is only in scope in the try block.  (In Java, the compile error is ""s cannot be resolved""; in C#, it's ""The name 's' does not exist in the current context"".)</p>

<p>The general solution to this issue seems to be to instead declare variables just before the try block, instead of within the try block:</p>

<pre><code>String s;
try {
  s = ""test"";
  // (more code...)
}
catch {
  Console.Out.WriteLine(s);  //Java fans: think ""System.out.println"" here instead
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, at least to me, (1) this feels like a clunky solution, and (2) it results in the variables having a larger scope than the programmer intended (the entire remainder of the method, instead of only in the context of the try-catch-finally).</p>

<p>My question is, what were/are the rationale(s) behind this language design decision (in Java, in C#, and/or in any other applicable languages)?  </p>

"<p>What is your best practical user-friendly user-interface design or principle? </p>

<p>Please submit those practices that you find actually makes things really useful - no matter  what - if it works for your users, share it!</p>

<hr>

<p>Summary/Collation</p>

<p>Principles</p>

<ol>
<li>KISS.</li>
<li>Be clear and specific in what an option will achieve: for example, use verbs that indicate the action that will follow on a choice (see: Impl. 1).</li>
<li>Use obvious default actions appropriate to what the user needs/wants to achieve.</li>
<li>Fit the appearance and behavior of the UI to the environment/process/audience: stand-alone application, web-page, portable, scientific analysis, flash-game, professionals/children, ...</li>
<li>Reduce the learning curve of a new user.</li>
<li>Rather than disabling or hiding options, consider giving a helpful message where the user can have alternatives, but only where those alternatives exist. If no alternatives are available, its better to disable the option - which visually then states that the option is not available - do not hide the unavailable options, rather explain in a mouse-over popup why it is disabled.</li>
<li>Stay consistent and conform to practices, and placement of controls, as is implemented in widely-used successful applications.</li>
<li>Lead the expectations of the user and let your program behave according to those expectations.</li>
<li>Stick to the vocabulary and knowledge of the user and do not use programmer/implementation terminology.</li>
<li>Follow basic design principles: contrast (obviousness), repetition (consistency), alignment (appearance), and proximity (grouping).</li>
</ol>

<p>Implementation</p>

<ol>
<li>(See answer by paiNie) ""Try to use verbs in your dialog boxes.""</li>
<li>Allow/implement undo and redo.</li>

"<p>Web applications that want to force a resource to be <em>downloaded</em> rather than directly <em>rendered</em> in a Web browser issue a <code>Content-Disposition</code> header in the HTTP response of the form:</p>

<p><code>Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=<em>FILENAME</em></code></p>

<p>The <code>filename</code> parameter can be used to suggest a name for the file into which the resource is downloaded by the browser. <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2183"">RFC 2183</a> (Content-Disposition), however, states in <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2183#section-2.3"">section 2.3</a> (The Filename Parameter) that the file name can only use US-ASCII characters:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Current [RFC 2045] grammar restricts
  parameter values (and hence
  Content-Disposition filenames) to
  US-ASCII.  We recognize the great
  desirability of allowing arbitrary
  character sets in filenames, but it is
  beyond the scope of this document to
  define the necessary mechanisms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is empirical evidence, nevertheless, that most popular Web browsers today seem to permit non-US-ASCII characters yet (for the lack of a standard) disagree on the encoding scheme and character set specification of the file name. Question is then, what are the various schemes and encodings employed by the popular browsers if the file name “naïvefile” (without quotes and where the third letter is U+00EF) needed to be encoded into the Content-Disposition header?</p>

"<p>I've been mystified by the R quantile function all day.  </p>

<p>I have an intuitive notion of how quantiles work, and an M.S. in stats, but boy oh boy, the documentation for it is confusing to me.  </p>

<p>From the docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q[i](p) = (1 - gamma) x[j] + gamma
  x[j+1],</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm with it so far.  For a type <em>i</em> quantile, it's an interpolation between x[j] and x [j+1], based on some mysterious constant <em>gamma</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>where 1 &lt;= i &lt;= 9, (j-m)/n &lt;= p &lt;
  (j-m+1)/ n, x[j] is the jth order
  statistic, n is the sample size, and m
  is a constant determined by the sample
  quantile type. Here gamma depends on
  the fractional part of g = np+m-j. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, how calculate j?   m?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the continuous sample quantile
  types (4 through 9), the sample
  quantiles can be obtained by linear
  interpolation between the kth order
  statistic and p(k): </p>
  
  <p>p(k) = (k - alpha) / (n - alpha - beta
  + 1),
  where α and β are constants determined
  by the type. Further, m = alpha + p(1
  - alpha - beta), and gamma = g.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now I'm really lost.  p, which was a constant before, is now apparently a function.  </p>

<p>So for Type 7 quantiles, the default...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Type 7</p>
  
  <p>p(k) = (k - 1) / (n - 1). In this case, p(k) = mode[F(x[k])]. This is used by S. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyone want to help me out?  In particular I'm confused by the notation of p being a function and a constant, what the heck <em>m</em> is, and now to calculate j for some particular <em>p</em>.  </p>

"<p>Without getting a degree in information retrieval, I'd like to know if there exists any algorithms for counting the frequency that words occur in a given body of text.

<p><strong>Caveats</strong>: The code snippet is a very simple repro. It is generated on the server and the second script is the only thing that changes.

"<p>C++ is all about memory ownership<br />
Aka ""<strong>Ownership Semantics</strong>""</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the owner of a chunk of dynamically allocated memory to release that memory. So the question really becomes who owns the memory.</p>

<p>In C++ ownership is documented by the type a RAW pointer is wrapped inside thus in a good (IMO) C++ program it is very rare [RARE not NEVER] to see RAW pointers passed around (as RAW pointers have no inferred ownership thus we can not tell who owns the memory and thus without careful reading of the documentation you can't tell who is responsible for ownership).</p>

<p>Conversely it is rare to see RAW pointers stored in a class each RAW pointer is stored within its own SMART pointer wrapper. (<B>N.B.:</b> If you don't own an object you should not be storing it because you can not know when it will go out of scope and be destroyed.)</p>

<p>So the question:</p>

<ul>
<li>What type of Ownership Semantic have people come across?</li>
<li>What standard classes are used to implement those semantics?</li>
<li>What situations do you find them useful?</li>
</ul>

<p>Lets keep 1 type of semantic ownership per answer so they can be voted up and down individually</p>

<h1>Summary:</h1>

<p>Conceptually smart pointers are simple and a naive implementations are easy. I have seen many attempted implementations, but invariably they are broken in some way that is not obvious to casual use and examples. Thus I recommend always using well tested ""Smart Pointers"" from a library rather than rolling your own. std::auto_ptr or one of the boost smart pointers seem to cover all my needs.</p>

<h2>std::auto_ptr&lt;T&gt;:</h2>

<p>Single person owns the object.<br>
   But transfer of ownership is allowed.<br></p>

<p>Usage:<br>
   ======<br>
   This allows you to define interfaces that show the explicit transfer of ownership.<br></p>

<h2>boost::scoped_ptr&lt;T&gt;<br></h2>

<p>Single person owns the object.<br>
   Transfer of ownership is NOT allowed.<br></p>

<p>Usage:<br>
   ======<br>
   Used to show explicit ownership.<br>
   Object will be destroyed by destructor or when explicitly reset.<br></p>

<h2>boost::shared_ptr&lt;T&gt; (std::tr1::shared_ptr&lt;T&gt;)<br></h2>

<p>Multiple ownership.<br>
   This is a simple reference counted pointer. When reference count reaches zero object is destroyed.<br></p>

<p>Usage:<br>
   ======<br>
   When object can have multiple owers with a lifetime that can not be determined at compile time.<br></p>

<h2>boost::weak_ptr&lt;T&gt;<br></h2>

<p>Used with shared_ptr&lt;T&gt;.<br>
   In situations where a cycle of pointers may happen.<br></p>

<p>Usage:<br>
   ======<br>
   Used to stop cycles from retaining objects when only the cycle is maintaining a shared refcount.<br></p>

    case ""Bob"":

    case ""Jill"":

if(childNode is Bob)
{
}
elseif(childNode is Jill)
{
}
else if(childNode is Marko)

<p><strong>Update:</strong> The main reason I ask this is because the switch statement is perculiar about what counts as a case. For example it wont allow you to use variables, only constants which get moved to the main assembly. I assumed it had this restriction due to some funky stuff it was doing. If it is only translating to elseifs (as one poster commented) then why are we not allowed variables in case statements?</p>

"<p>Since the only operations required for a container to be used in a stack are:</p>

<ul>
<li>back()</li>
<li>push_back()</li>
<li>pop_back()</li>
</ul>

<p>Why is the default container for it a deque instead of a vector?</p>

<p>Don't deque reallocations give a buffer of elements before front() so that push_front() is an efficient operation? Aren't these elements wasted since they will never ever be used in the context of a stack?</p>

<p>If there is no overhead for using a deque this way instead of a vector, why is the default for priority_queue a vector not a deque also? (priority_queue requires front(), push_back(), and pop_back() - essentially the same as for stack)</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Updated based on the Answers below:</strong></p>

<p>It appears that the way deque is usually implemented is a variable size array of fixed size arrays. This makes growing faster than a vector (which requires reallocation and copying), so for something like a stack which is all about adding and removing elements, deque is likely a better choice. </p>

<p>priority_queue requires indexing heavily, as every removal and insertion requires you to run pop_heap() or push_heap(). This probably makes vector a better choice there since adding an element is still amortized constant anyways.</p>

"<p>I need to store user entered changes to a particular table, but not show those changes until they have been viewed and approved by an administrative user.  While those changes are still  in a pending state, I would still display the old version of the data.  What would be the best way of storing these changes waiting for approval?</p>

<p>I have thought of several ways, but can't figure out what is the best method.  This is a very small web app.  One way would be to have a PendingChanges table that mimics the other table's schema, and then once the change is approved, I could update the real table with the information.  Another approach would be to do some sort of record versioning where I store multiple versions of the data in the table and then always pull the record with the highest version number that has been marked approved.  That would limit the number of extra tables (I need to do this for multiple tables), but would require me to do extra processing every time I pull out a set of records to make sure I get the right ones.</p>

<p>Any personal experiences with these methods or others that might be good?</p>

<p>Update: Just to clarify, in this particular situation I am not interested so much in historical data.  I just need some way of approving any changes that are made by a user before they go live on the site.  So, a user will edit their ""profile"" and then an administrator will look at that modification and approve it.  Once approved, that will become the displayed value and the old version does not need to be kept.</p>

<p>Anybody tried the solution below where you store pending changes from any table that needs to track them as XML in a special PendingChanges table?  Each record would have a column that said which table the changes were for, a column that maybe stored the id of the record that would be changed (null if it's a new record), a datetime column to store when the change was made, and a column to store the xml of the changed record (could maybe serialize my data object).  Since I don't need history, after a change was approved, the real table would be updated and the PendingChange record could be deleted.</p>

"<p>I want to try to convert a string to a Guid, but I don't want to rely on catching exceptions (</p>

<ul>
<li>for performance reasons - exceptions are expensive</li>
<li>for usability reasons - the debugger pops up </li>
<li>for design reasons - the expected is not exceptional</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words the code:</p>

<p>I would try using RegEx, but since the guid can be parenthesis wrapped, brace wrapped, none wrapped, makes it hard. </p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/104850/c-test-if-string-is-a-guid-without-throwing-exceptions#137829"">ChristianK</a> had a good idea to catch only <code>FormatException</code>, rather than all. Changed the question's code sample to include suggestion.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong></p>

<p>Why worry about thrown exceptions? Am I really expecting invalid GUIDs all that often? </p>

<p>The answer is <em>yes</em>. That is why I am using TryStrToGuid - I <strong>am</strong> expecting bad data.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong> <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc144096%28VS.85%29.aspx"">Namespace extensions can be specified by appending a GUID to a folder name</a>. I might be parsing folder names, checking to see if the text after the final <strong>.</strong> is a GUID.</p>

c:\Users.old
c:\UserManager.{CE7F5AA5-6832-43FE-BAE1-80D14CD8F666}
c:\Windows
c:\Windows.old

<p><strong>Example 2</strong> I might be running a heavily used web-server wants to check the validity of some posted back data. I don't want invalid data tying up resources 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than it needs to be.</p>

<p><strong>Example 3</strong> I might be parsing a search expression entered by a user. </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ghb12.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

"<p>I am working on an application and one design approach involves extremely heavy use of the <code>instanceof</code> operator. While I know that OO design generally tries to avoid using <code>instanceof</code>, that is a different story and this question is purely related to performance. I was wondering if there is any performance impact? Is is just as fast as <code>==</code>?</p>

<p>For example, I have a base class with 10 subclasses. In a single function that takes the base class, I do checks for if the class is an instance of the subclass and carry out some routine. </p>

<p>One of the other ways I thought of solving it was to use a ""type id"" integer primitive instead, and use a bitmask to represent categories of the subclasses, and then just do a bit mask comparison of the subclasses ""type id"" to a constant mask representing the category.</p>

<p>Is <code>instanceof</code> somehow optimized by the JVM to be faster than that? I want to stick to Java but the performance of the app is critical. It would be cool if someone that has been down this road before could offer some advice. Am I nitpicking too much or focusing on the wrong thing to optimize?</p>

"<p>After reading ""<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20702/whats-youra-good-limit-for-cyclomatic-complexity"">What’s your/a good limit for cyclomatic complexity?</a>"", I realize many of my colleagues were quite annoyed with this new <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance"">QA</a> policy on our project: no more 10 <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity"">cyclomatic complexity</a> per function.</p>

<p>Meaning: no more than 10 'if', 'else', 'try', 'catch' and other code workflow branching statement. Right. As I explained in '<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/105007/do-you-test-private-method#105114"">Do you test private method?</a>', such a policy has many good side-effects.</p>

<p>But: At the beginning of our (200 people - 7 years long) project, we were happily logging (and no, we can not easily delegate that to some kind of '<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming"">Aspect-oriented programming</a>' approach for logs).</p>

<pre><code>myLogger.info(""A String"");
myLogger.fine(""A more complicated String"");
...
</code></pre>

<p>And when the first versions of our System went live, we experienced huge memory problem not because of the logging (which was at one point turned off), but because of the <em>log parameters</em> (the strings), which are always calculated, then passed to the 'info()' or 'fine()' functions, only to discover that the level of logging was 'OFF', and that no logging were taking place!</p>

<p>So QA came back and urged our programmers to do conditional logging. Always.</p>

<pre><code>if(myLogger.isLoggable(Level.INFO) { myLogger.info(""A String"");
if(myLogger.isLoggable(Level.FINE) { myLogger.fine(""A more complicated String"");
...
</code></pre>

<p>But now, with that 'can-not-be-moved' 10 cyclomatic complexity level per function limit, they argue that the various logs they put in their function is felt as a burden, because each ""if(isLoggable())"" is counted as +1 cyclomatic complexity!</p>

<p>So if a function has 8 'if', 'else' and so on, in one tightly-coupled not-easily-shareable algorithm, and 3 critical log actions... they breach the limit even though the conditional logs may not be <em>really</em> part of said complexity of that function...</p>

<p>How would you address this situation ?<br>
I have seen a couple of interesting coding evolution (due to that 'conflict') in my project, but I just want to get your thoughts first.</p>

<hr>

<p>Thank you for all the answers.<br>
I must insist that the problem is not 'formatting' related, but 'argument evaluation' related (evaluation that can be very costly to do, just before calling a method which will do nothing)<br>
So when a wrote above ""A String"", I actually meant aFunction(), with aFunction() returning a String, and being a call to a complicated method collecting and computing all kind of log data to be displayed by the logger... or not (hence the issue, and the <em>obligation</em> to use conditional logging, hence the actual issue of artificial increase of 'cyclomatic complexity'...)</p>

<p>I now get the '<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variadic_function"">variadic</a> function' point advanced by some of you (thank you John).<br>
Note: a quick test in java6 shows that my <a href=""http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/varargs.html"">varargs function</a> does evaluate its arguments before being called, so it can not be applied for function call, but for 'Log retriever object' (or 'function wrapper'), on which the toString() will only be called if needed. Got it.</p>

I will leave it there until next Tuesday for voting, then I will select one of your answers.<br>

    //initialize the statement

"<p>In PHP, the HEREDOC string declarations are really useful for outputting a block of html.  You can have it parse in variables just by prefixing them with $, but for more complicated syntax (like $var[2][3]), you have to put your expression inside {} braces.</p>

<p>In PHP 5, it <em>is</em> possible to actually make function calls within {} braces inside a HEREDOC string, but you have to go through a bit of work.  The function name itself has to be stored in a variable, and you have to call it like it is a dynamically-named function.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>$fn = 'testfunction';
function testfunction() { return 'ok'; }
$string = &lt;&lt;&lt; heredoc
plain text and now a function: {$fn()}
heredoc;
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, this is a bit more messy than just:</p>

<pre><code>$string = &lt;&lt;&lt; heredoc
plain text and now a function: {testfunction()}
heredoc;
</code></pre>

<p>There are other ways besides the first code example, such as breaking out of the HEREDOC to call the function, or reversing the issue and doing something like:</p>

<pre><code>?&gt;
&lt;!-- directly output html and only breaking into php for the function --&gt;
plain text and now a function: &lt;?PHP print testfunction(); ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The latter has the disadvantage that the output is directly put into the output stream (unless I'm using output buffering), which might not be what I want.</p>

<p>So, the essence of my question is: is there a more elegant way to approach this?</p>

<p><b>Edit based on responses:</b> It certainly does seem like some kind of template engine would make my life much easier, but it would require me basically invert my usual PHP style.  Not that that's a bad thing, but it explains my inertia..  I'm up for figuring out ways to make life easier though, so I'm looking into templates now.</p>

"<p>I have a stateless bean something like:</p>

<pre><code>@Stateless
public class MyStatelessBean implements MyStatelessLocal, MyStatelessRemote {
    @PersistenceContext(unitName=""myPC"")
    private EntityManager mgr;

    @TransationAttribute(TransactionAttributeType.SUPPORTED)
    public void processObjects(List&lt;Object&gt; objs) {
        // this method just processes the data; no need for a transaction
        for(Object obj : objs) {
            this.process(obj);
        }
    }

    @TransationAttribute(TransactionAttributeType.REQUIRES_NEW)

        // do some work with obj that must be in the scope of a transaction

        this.mgr.merge(obj);
        // ...
        this.mgr.flush();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The typically usage then is the client would call processObjects(...), which doesn't actually interact with the entity manager. It does what it needs to do and calls process(...) individually for each object to process. The duration of process(...) is relatively short, but processObjects(...) could take a very long time to run through everything. Therefore I don't want it to maintain an open transaction. I <em>do</em> need the individual process(...) operations to operate within their own transaction. This should be a new transaction for every call. Lastly I'd like to keep the option open for the client to call process(...) directly.</p>

<p>I've tried a number of different transaction types: never, not supported, supported (on processObjects) and required, requires new (on process) but I get TransactionRequiredException every time merge() is called.</p>

<p>I've been able to make it work by splitting up the methods into two different beans:</p>

    }

        this.mgr.merge(obj);

"<p>I need to write a Java Comparator class that compares Strings, however with one twist.  If the two strings it is comparing are the same at the beginning and end of the string are the same, and the middle part that differs is an integer, then compare based on the numeric values of those integers.  For example, I want the following strings to end up in order they're shown:</p>

<ul>
<li>aaa</li>
<li>bbb 3 ccc</li>
<li>bbb 12 ccc</li>

</code></pre>

<p>It looks like the tricky part here may lie in the fact that the path is relative to the .csproj file, not the .sln file which is the current directory in Vim and lies one directory above the .csproj file.</p>

<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>
I figured it out...</p>

<pre><code>set errorformat=\ %#%f(%l\\\,%c):\ %m
</code></pre>

<p>This will capture the output for both devenv /Build and msbuild.
However, msbuild has one catch.  By default, it's output doesn't include full paths.  To fix this you have to add the following line to your csproj file's main PropertyGroup:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you are implementing reference
  types, you should consider overriding
  the Equals method on a reference type
  if your type looks like a base type
  such as a Point, String, BigNumber,
  and so on. Most reference types should
  not overload the <strong>equality</strong> operator,
  even <strong>if they override Equals</strong>. However,
  if you are implementing a reference
  type that is intended to have value
  semantics, such as a complex number
  type, you should override the equality
  operator.</p>

"<p>I am looking into an image processing problem for semi-real time detection of certain scenarios.  My goal is to have the live video arrive as Motion JPEG frames in my Java code <em>somehow</em>.  </p>

<p>I am familiar with the <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/desktop/media/jmf/"">Java Media Framework</a> and, sadly, I think we can consider that an effectively dead API.  I am also familiar with <a href=""http://www.axis.com/"">Axis boxes</a> and, while I really like their solution, I would appreciate any critical feedback on my specific points of interest.  </p>

<p>This is how I define ""best"" for the purpose of this discussion:</p>

<ul>
<li>Latency - if I'm controlling the camera using this video stream, I would like to keep my round-trip latency at less than 100 milliseconds if possible.  That's measured as the time between my control input to the time when I see the visible change.  EDIT some time later: another thing to keep in mind is that camera control is likely to be a combination of manual and automatic (event triggers).  We need to see those pictures right away, even if the high quality feed is archived separately.</li>
<li>Cost - free / open source is better than not free.</li>
<li>Adjustable codec parameters - I need to be able to tune the codec for certain situations.  Sometimes a high-speed low-resolution stream is actually easier to process.</li>
<li>""Integration"" with Java - how much trouble is it to hook this solution to my code?  Am I sending packets over a socket?  Hitting URLs?  Installing Direct3D / JNI combinations?</li>
<li>Windows / Linux / both? - I would prefer an operating system agnostic solution because I have to deliver to several flavors of OS but there may be a solution that is optimal for one but not the other.</li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE: I am aware of other image / video capture codecs and that is not the focus of this question.  I am specifically <em>not</em> interested in streaming APIs (e.g., MPEG4) due to the loss of frame accuracy.  However, if there is a solution to my question that delivers another frame-accurate data stream, please chime in.</p>

<p>Follow-up to this question: at this point, I am strongly inclined to buy appliances such as the <a href=""http://www.axis.com/products/video/video_server/index.htm"">Axis video encoders</a> rather than trying to capture the video in software or on the PC directly.  However, if someone has alternatives, I'd love to hear them.</p>

for example:</p>

<pre><code>E1101:125:get_user_tags: Class 'Tag' has no 'objects' member

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> The only way I've found to tell pylint to not warn about these warnings is by blocking all errors of the type (E1101) which is not an acceptable solution, since that is (in my opinion) an extremely useful error.

What are the advantages of having a contiguous block of memory? Specifically, why would I need to have a contiguous <strong>physical</strong> block of memory in a <em>system call</em>? Is there any reason I couldn't just use <code>vmalloc</code>?<br>

"<p>We have a large backlog of things we should do in our software, in a lot of different categories, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>New problem areas for our products to solve </li>
<li>New functionality supporting existing problem areas</li>
<li>New functionality requested by our existing users</li>
<li>Usability and ""look"" enhancements</li>
<li>Architectural upgrades to the back-end</li>
<li>Bug fixes</li>
</ul>

<p>Managing all of these in a sensible fashion is a job that falls to Product Management, but it is tricky for a lot of reasons.  Firstly, we have a number of different systems that hold the different things (market requirements document in files, bugs in a bug database, customer requirements in our help desk system, enginering's wish-list on our intranet, etc).  And secondly, many of the items are of wildly different size, scope, complexity and of course value, which means that choosing isn't as simple as just ordering a list by priority.  </p>

<p>Because we now are fairly large, have a complex product and lots of customers, the basic solutions (a spreadsheet, a google doc, a basecamp to-do list) just isn't sufficient to deal with this.  We need a way to group things together in various ways, prioritise them on an ongoing basis, make it clear what we're doing and what is coming - without it requiring all of someone's time to just manage some tool.</p>

<p>How do you manage this in a way that allows the business to always do what is most valuable to existing customers, helps get new ones, and keeps the software innards sane?</p>

<p>Note that this is different from the development-side, which I think we have down pretty well.  We develop everything in an iterative, agile fashion, and once something has been chosen for design and implementation, we can do that.  It's the part where we need to figure out what to do next that's hardest!</p>

<p>Have you found a method or a tool that works?  If so, please share!  (And if you would like to know the answer too, rate up the question so it stays visible :)</p>

<p><I>Addendum:</i> Of course it's nice to fix all the bugs first, but in a real system that actually is installed on customers' machines, that is not always practical.  For example, we may have a bug that only occurs very rarely and that it would take a huge amount of time and architectural upheaval to fix - we might leave that for a while.  Or we might have a bug where someone thinks something is hard to use, and we think fixing it should wait for a bigger revamp of that area.  So, there are lots of reasons why we don't just fix them all straight away, but keep them open so we don't forget.  Besides, it is the prioritization of the non-bugs that is the hardest; just imagine we don't have any :)</p>

<li>deleted record</li>
<li>modified record</li>
<li>existing record</li>

<p>So, it seems I have three possible appoaches:</p>

#define X_MODIFIED 0x04

"<p>If you had read my other <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/111700/6502-cpu-emulation"">question</a>, you'll know I've spent this weekend putting together a 6502 CPU emulator as a programming exercise.</p>

<p>The CPU emulator is mostly complete, and seems to be fairly accurate from my limited testing, however it is running incredibly fast, and I want to throttle it down to the actual clock speed of the machine.</p>

<p>My current test loop is this:</p>

<pre><code>    // Just loop infinitely.
    while (1 == 1)
    {                
        CPU.ClockCyclesBeforeNext--;

        if (CPU.ClockCyclesBeforeNext &lt;= 0)
        {
            // Find out how many clock cycles this instruction will take
            CPU.ClockCyclesBeforeNext = CPU.OpcodeMapper.Map[CPU.Memory[CPU.PC]].CpuCycles;

            // Run the instruction
            CPU.ExecuteInstruction(CPU.Memory[CPU.PC]);

            // Debugging Info
            CPU.DumpDebug();
            Console.WriteLine(CPU.OpcodeMapper.Map[CPU.Memory[CPU.PC]].ArgumentLength);

            // Move to next instruction
            CPU.PC += 1 + CPU.OpcodeMapper.Map[CPU.Memory[CPU.PC]].ArgumentLength;                                        
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>As you can tell, each opcode takes a specific amount of time to complete, so I do not run the next instruction until I count down the CPU Cycle clock. This provides proper timing between opcodes, its just that the entire thing runs way to fast.</p>

<p>The targeted CPU speed is 1.79mhz, however I'd like whatever solution to the clock issue to keep the speed at 1.79mhz even as I add complexity, so I don't have to adjust it up.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>I have read a number of papers on <code>Kalman filters</code>, but there seem to be few good publically accessible worked examples of getting from mathematical paper to actual working code.</p>

<p>I have a system containing a three-axis accelerometer and a single gyro measuring rotation around one of the accelerometer axes. The system is designed to be held by a human, and much of the time the gyro will be measuring rotation about the gravity vector or close to it. (People working in the same industry will likely recognise what I am talking about from that ;)) I realise this is underconstrained.</p>

<p>The gyros appear to have a near-constant bias that is slightly different for each instance of the system. How would I go about coding a filter to use the accelerometer readings to calibrate the gyro at times when the system is tilted so the gyro axis is not collinear with gravity, and is being rotated about the gyro axis? It seems like there should be enough information to do that, but being told that there isn't and why would be an answer too :)</p>

"<p>Although I do understand the serious implications of playing with this function (or at least that's what I think), I fail to see why it's becoming one of these things that respectable programmers wouldn't ever use, even those who don't even know what it is for.</p>

<p>Let's say I'm developing an application where memory usage varies extremely depending on what the user is doing. The application life cycle can be divided into two main stages: editing and real-time processing. During the editing stage, suppose that billions or even trillions of objects are created; some of them small and some of them not, some may have finalizers and some may not, and suppose their lifetimes vary from a very few milliseconds to long hours. Next, the user decides to switch to the real-time stage. At this point, suppose that performance plays a fundamental role and the slightest alteration in the program's flow could bring catastrophic consequences. Object creation is then reduced to the minimum possible by using object pools and the such but then, the GC chimes in unexpectedly and throws it all away, and someone dies.</p>

<p>The question: In this case, wouldn't it be wise to call GC.Collect() before entering the second stage?</p>

<p>After all, these two stages never overlap in time with each other and all the optimization and statistics the GC could have gathered would be of little use here...</p>

<p>Note: As some of you have pointed out, .NET might not be the best platform for an application like this, but that's beyond the scope of this question. The intent is to clarify whether a GC.Collect() call can improve an application's overall behaviour/performance or not. We all agree that the circumstances under which you would do such a thing are extremely rare but then again, the GC tries to guess and does it perfectly well most of the time, but it's still about guessing.</p>

"<p>I'm using castle windsor for a pet-project I'm working on. I'm starting to notice that I need to call the IoC container in different places in my code to create new objects. This dependency on the container makes my code harder to maintain.</p>

<p>There are two solutions I've used to solve this problem</p>

<p>I tried to create abstract factories as wrappers around the container that I could inject into parts of my application that need to create objects. This works but has some drawbacks because castle has a hard time injecting it's own container as a dependency. So I have to do that by hand, this kind of defeats the whole purpose of the IoC container.</p>

<p>I have used the main applicationcontroller class to wrap the IoC container and work as a central factory/repository. This was quite succesfull but this class is getting too big and acts like a central god-object, almost every other objects has a reference to it.</p>

<p>Both solutions sort of work but both have their drawbacks. So I'm curious if other people had the same problem and have found better solutions.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><em>edit</em>
The problem isn't for object A that depends on object B. Here I usually just use constructor injection and everything works. Sometimes I have objects of type A that need to create a variable number of other objects of type B during their lifetime. I'm not sure how to do this.</p>

<p>@Blair Conrad: The maintenance issues are not severe until now. I had some classes depend on the container object calling container.Resolve&lt;>. And I don't want to have my code depending on what I think is infrastructure. I'm still trying things out so I noticed I had to change a lot of code when switching from ninject to castle for this project.</p>

<p>@flowers: Hmm. I like your fists solution. It combines the things that work from both solutions I've tried. I think I was still thinking too much in objects and not enough in interfaces/responsibilities.

"<p>How to slurp a file into a <code>std::string</code>, i.e., read the whole file at once? Text or binary mode should be specified by the caller. The solution should be standard-compliant, portable and efficient. It should not needlessly copy the string's data, and it should avoid reallocations of memory while reading the string.</p>

<p>One way to do this would be to stat the filesize, resize the <code>std::string</code> and <code>fread()</code> into the <code>std::string</code>'s <code>const_cast&lt;char*&gt;()</code>'ed <code>data()</code>. This requires the <code>std::string</code>'s data to be contiguous which is not required by the standard but appears to be the case for all known implementations. What is worse, if the file is read in text mode, the <code>std::string</code>'s size may not equal the file's size.</p>

<p>Fully correct, standard-compliant and portable solutions could be constructed using <code>std::ifstream</code>'s <code>rdbuf()</code> into a <code>std::ostringstream</code> and from there into a <code>std::string</code>. However, this could copy the string data and/or needlessly reallocate memory. Are all relevant standard library implementations smart enough to avoid all unnecessary overhead?

<p>Create a resource file, for example 'Lang.en-us.resx' and one for every language, for example 'Lang.nl-nl.resx' and fill it up with Strings.

"<h2>I've actually solved this, but I'm posting it for posterity.</h2>

<p>I ran into a very odd issue with the DataGridView on my dual-monitor system. The issue manifests itself as an EXTREMELY slow repaint of the control (<em>like 30 seconds for a full repaint</em>), but only when it is on one of my screens. When on the other, the repaint speed is fine. I have an nVidia 8800 GT with the latest non-beta drivers (175. something). Is it a driver bug? I'll leave that up in the air, since I have to live with this particular configuration. (It does not happen on ATI cards, though...) </p>

<p>The paint speed has nothing to do with the cell contents, and custom drawing doesn't improve the performance at all - even when just painting a solid rectangle.</p>

<p>I later find out that placing a ElementHost (from the System.Windows.Forms.Integration namespace) on the form corrects the problem. It doesn't have to be messed with, it just needs to be a child of the form the DataGridView is also on. It can be resized to (0, 0)  as long as the <em>Visible</em> property is true.</p>

<p>Not wanting to explicitly add the .Net 3/3.5 dependency to my app, I make a method to create this control at runtime (if it can) using reflection. It works, and at least it fails gracefully on machines that don't have the required library - it just goes back to being slow. </p>

<p>This method also lets me apply to fix while the app is running, making it easier to see what the WPF libraries are changing on my form (using Spy++).</p>

<p>After a lot of trial and error, I notice that enabling double buffering on the control itself (as opposed to just the form) corrects the issue! </p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>So, you just need to make a custom class based off of DataGridView so you can enable its DoubleBuffering. That's it!</p>

<pre><code>class CustomDataGridView: DataGridView
{
    public CustomDataGridView()
    {
        DoubleBuffered = true;
    } 
}
</code></pre>

<p>As long as all of my instances of the grid are using this custom version, all is well. If I ever run into a situation caused by this where I'm not able to use the subclass solution (if I don't have the code), I suppose I could try to inject that control onto the form :) (<em>although I'll be more likely to try using reflection to force the DoubleBuffered property on from the outside to once again avoid the dependency</em>). </p>

<p>It is sad that such a trivially simple thing ate up so much of my time...</p>

"<p>No doubt, it's essential for understanding code to give member variables a prefix so that they can easily be distinguished from ""normal"" variables.</p>

<p>But what kind of prefix do you use?</p>

<p>I have been working on projects where we used <strong>m_</strong> as prefix, on other projects we used an underscore only (which I personally don't like, because an underscore only is not demonstrative enough).</p>

<p>On another project we used a long prefix form, that also included the variable type. <strong>mul_</strong> for example is the prefix of a <strong>m</strong>ember variable of type <strong>u</strong>nsigned <strong>l</strong>ong.</p>

<p>Now let me know what kind of prefix you use (and please give a reason for it).</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Most of you seem to code without special prefixes for member variables! Does this depend on the language? From my experience, <strong>C++ code</strong> tends to use an underscore or <strong>m_</strong> as a prefix for member variables. What about other languages?</p>

"<p>For one and a half years, I have been keeping my eyes on the git community in hopes of making the switch away from SVN.  One particular issue holding me back is the inability to lock binary files. Throughout the past year I have yet to see developments on this issue.  I understand that locking files goes against the fundamental principles of distributed source control, but I don't see how a web development company can take advantage of git to track source code and image file changes when there is the potential for binary file conflicts.</p>

<p>To achieve the effects of locking, a ""central"" repository must be identified.  Regardless of the distributed nature of git, most companies will have a ""central"" repository for a software project.  We should be able to mark a file as requiring a lock from the governing git repository at a specified address.  Perhaps this is made difficult because git tracks file contents not files?</p>

<p>Do any of you have experience in dealing with git and binary files that should be locked before modification?</p>

"<p>Consider a <em>hypothetical</em> method of an object that does stuff for you:</p>

   public void CancelDoingStuff()
   {
      _worker.CancelAsync();

   }

<p>How can one wait for a BackgroundWorker to be done? </p>

<hr>

<p>In the past people have tried:</p>

<pre><code>   while (!_worker.IsDone)
   {
      Sleep(100);
   }
</code></pre>

<p>But <a href=""http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=1819196&amp;SiteID=1"">this is a deadlock</a>, since the <code>IsBusy</code> is not cleared until after the <code>RunWorkerCompleted</code> event is handled, and that event won't get handled until the application goes idle. The application won't go idle until the worker is done. (Plus, it's a busy loop - and how disgusting is that)</p>

<p>Others have add suggested kludging it into:</p>

<pre><code>   while (!_worker.IsDone)
   {
      Application.DoEvents();
   }
</code></pre>

<p>Problem with that is that is <code>Application.DoEvents()</code> causes messages currently in the queue to be processed, which cause re-entrantcy problems (.NET isn't re-entrant).</p>

<p>i would hope to use some solution involving Event synchronization objects, where the code <strong>waits</strong> for an event - that the worker's <code>RunWorkerCompleted</code> event handlers sets. Something like:</p>

<pre><code>   Event _workerDoneEvent = new WaitHandle();

   public void CancelDoingStuff()
   {
      _worker.CancelAsync();
      _workerDoneEvent.WaitOne();
   }

   private void RunWorkerCompletedEventHandler(sender object, RunWorkerCompletedEventArgs e)
   {
      _workerDoneEvent.SetEvent();
   }
</code></pre>

<p>But i'm back to the deadlock: the event handler can't run until the application goes idle, and the application won't go idle because it's waiting for an Event.</p>

<p>So how can you wait for an BackgroundWorker to finish?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update</strong> 
People seem to be confused by this question. They seem to think that i will be using the BackgroundWorker as:</p>

<pre><code>BackgroundWorker worker = new BackgroundWorker();
worker.DoWork += MyWork;
worker.RunWorkerAsync();
WaitForWorkerToFinish(worker);
</code></pre>

<p>That is <em>not</em> it, that is <em>not</em> what i'm doing, and that is <em>not</em> what is being asked here. If that were the case, there would be no point in using a background worker.</p>

"<p>I am working with a Visual Studio 2005 C++ solution that includes multiple projects (about 30). 
Based upon my experience, it often becomes annoying to maintain all the properties of the  projects (i.e include path, lib path, linked libs, code generation options, ...), as you often have to click each and every project in order to modify them.
The situation becomes even worse when you have multiple configurations (Debug, Release, Release 64 bits, ...).</p>

<p>Real life examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Assume you want to use a new library, and you need to add the include path to this library to all projects. 
How will you avoid to have to edit the properties of each an every project?</li>
<li>Assume you want to test drive a new version of library (say version 2.1beta) so that you need to quickly change the include paths / library path / linked library for a set of projects?</li>
</ul>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>I am aware that it is possible to select multiple projects at a time, then make a right click and select ""properties"". However this method only works for properties that were already exactly identical for the different projects : you can not use it in order to add an include path to a set of project that were using different include path.</li>
<li>I also know that it is possible to modify globally the environment options (Tools/Options/Project And solutions/Directories), however it is not that satisfying since it can not be integrated into a SCM</li>
<li>I also know that one can add ""Configurations"" to a solutions. It does not helps since it makes another set of project properties to maintain</li>
<li>I know that codegear C++ Builder 2009 offers a viable answer to this need through so called ""Option sets"" which can be inherited by several projects (I use both Visual Studio and C++ Builder, and I still thinks C++ Builder rocks on certain aspects as compared to Visual Studio) </li>

"<p>I've found an <a href=""http://chrison.net/UACElevationInManagedCodeStartingElevatedCOMComponents.aspx"">article</a> on how to elevate a COM object written in C++ by calling 
<code>CoCreateInstanceAsAdmin</code>. But what I have not been able to find or do, is a way to implement a component of my .NET (c#) application as a COM object and then call into that object to execute the tasks which need UAC elevation. MSDN documents this as the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb756990.aspx"">admin COM object model</a>.</p>

<p>I am aware that it is possible and quite easy to launch the application (or another app) as an administrator, to execute the tasks in a separate process (see for instance the <a href=""http://www.danielmoth.com/Blog/2006/12/launch-elevated-and-modal-too.html"">post from Daniel Moth</a>, but what I am looking for is a way to do everything from within the same, un-elevated .NET executable. Doing so will, of course, spawn the COM object in a new process, but thanks to transparent marshalling, the caller of the .NET COM object should not be (too much) aware of it.</p>

<p>Any ideas as to how I could instanciate a COM object written in C#, from a C# project, through the <code>CoCreateInstanceAsAdmin</code> API would be very helpful. So I am really interested in learning how to write a COM object in C#, which I can then invoke from C# through the COM elevation APIs.</p>

<p>Never mind if the elevated COM object does not run in the same process. I just don't want to have to launch the whole application elevated; I would just like to have the COM object which will execute the code be elevated. If I could write something along the lines:</p>

<pre><code>// in a dedicated assembly, marked with the following attributes:
[assembly: ComVisible (true)]
[assembly: Guid (""...."")]

public class ElevatedClass
{
    public void X() { /* do something */ }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and then have my main application just instanciate <code>ElevatedClass</code> through the <code>CoCreateInstanceAsAdmin</code> call. But maybe I am just dreaming.</p>

"<p>What guidelines can you give for rich HTML formatting in emails while maintaining good visual stability across many clients and web based email interfaces?</p>

<p>An unrelated answer on a question on Stack Overflow suggested:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/archives/2008/05/2008_email_design_guidelines.html"">http://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/archives/2008/05/2008_email_design_guidelines.html</a></p>

<p>Which contains the following guidelines:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Place stylesheet in <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> instead of <code>&lt;head&gt;</code></strong><br />
Some email clients will strip CSS out of the head, but leave it if the style block is (invalidly) in the body. </li>
<li><strong>Use inline styles where ever possible</strong><br />
Gmail will strip any stylesheet, whether in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> or in the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, but honor inline styles assigned using the <code>style=""""</code> attribute</li>
<li><strong>Return to tables</strong><br />
Email standards have actually taken a giant step backwards in recent years thanks to Outlook 2007 using the Microsoft Word rendering engine. Unlearn most of what you learned about positioning without stylesheets.</li>
<li><strong>Don't rely on images</strong><br />
Most clients and most web based email clients will not display images unless the user specifically requests them to be displayed.</li>
</ol>

<p>I also have a few ""unconfirmed"" truths that I don't remember where I read them.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Don't use more than two levels of nesting in tables</strong><br />
Is this true. What is likely to happen if I do? Is there any particular client/clients that choke on this?</li>
<li><strong>Be careful of nesting background images in cells/tables</strong><br />
As I understand you may encounter situations where the background image is applied in the descending table/cell completely anew, and not just ""shining through"". Again, true or not? Which clients?</li>
</ol>

<p>I would like to flesh out this list with more guidelines and experiences from the trenches.</p>

"<p>I know Googling I can find an appropriate answer, but I prefer listening to your personal (and maybe technical) opinions.<br/>
<strong>What is the main reason of the difference between Java and C# in throwing exceptions?</strong><br/>

"<p>In Java, web apps are bundled in to WARs. By default, many servlet containers will use the WAR name as the context name for the application.</p>

<p>Thus myapp.war gets deployed to <a href=""http://example.com/myapp"">http://example.com/myapp</a>.</p>

<p>The problem is that the webapp considers its ""root"" to be, well, ""root"", or simply ""/"", whereas HTML would consider the root of your application to be ""/myapp"".</p>

<p>The Servlet API and JSP have facilities to help manage this. For example, if, in a servlet, you do: response.sendRedirect(""/mypage.jsp""), the container will prepend the context and create the url: <a href=""http://example.com/myapp/mypage.jsp"">http://example.com/myapp/mypage.jsp</a>"".</p>

<p>However, you can't do that with, say, the IMG tag in HTML. If you do &lt;img src=""/myimage.gif""/> you will likely get a 404, because what you really wanted was ""/myapp/myimage.gif"".</p>

<p>Many frameworks have JSP tags that are context aware as well, and there are different ways of making correct URLs within JSP (none particularly elegantly).</p>

<p>It's a nitty problem for coders to jump in an out of when to use an ""App Relative"" url, vs an absolute url.</p>

<p>Finally, there's the issue of Javascript code that needs to create URLs on the fly, and embedded URLs within CSS (for background images and the like).</p>

<p>I'm curious what techniques others use to mitigate and work around this issue. Many simply punt and hard code it, either to server root or to whatever context they happen to be using. I already know that answer, that's not what I'm looking for.</p>

<p>But I do have a little question about the coding style of if/else control block used by the tutorial.</p>

<p>In the wikibook, the code look like the following:</p>

<pre><code>doGuessing num = do
   putStrLn ""Enter your guess:""
   guess &lt;- getLine
   if (read guess) &lt; num
     then do putStrLn ""Too low!""
             doGuessing num
     else if (read guess) &gt; num
            then do putStrLn ""Too high!""
                    doGuessing num
            else do putStrLn ""You Win!""
</code></pre>

<p>It makes me confusing, because this coding style is totally volate ""Good Coding Style"" in C-sytnax like programming language, where we should ident if/else if/else at same column.</p>

<p>I know it just not work in Haskell, because it would cause parse error if I ident ""else"" at same column of ""if"".</p>

<p>But what about the following one? I think it is much more clear then the above one. But since the above is used by Wikibook and Yet Another Haskell Tutorial, which marked ""best tutorial available online"" at offical Haskell website, so I'm not sure whether this coding style is a convention in Haskell programs.</p>

<pre><code>doGuessing num = do
    putStrLn ""Enter your guess:""
    guess &lt;- getLine
    if (read guess) &lt; num then
        do 
            putStrLn ""Too low!""
            doGuessing num

<p>To maximize the testability of code, follow these rules:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Write the test first, then the code.</strong> Reason: This ensures that you write testable code and that every line of code gets tests written for it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Design classes using dependency injection.</strong> Reason: You cannot mock or test what cannot be seen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Separate UI code from its behavior using Model-View-Controller or Model-View-Presenter.</strong> Reason: Allows the business logic to be tested while the parts that can't be tested (the UI) is minimized.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do not write static methods or classes.</strong>  Reason: Static methods are difficult or impossible to isolate and Rhino Mocks is unable to mock them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Program off interfaces, not classes.</strong> Reason: Using interfaces clarifies the relationships between objects. An interface should define a service that an object needs from its environment.  Also, interfaces can be easily mocked using Rhino Mocks and other mocking frameworks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Isolate external dependencies.</strong> Reason: Unresolved external dependencies cannot be tested.</p></li>

"<p>I have an application that we're trying to migrate to 64bit from 32bit.  It's .NET, compiled using the x64 flags.  However, we have a large number of DLLs written in FORTRAN 90 compiled for 32bit.  The functions in the FORTRAN DLLs are fairly simple:  you put data in, you pull data out; no state of any sort.  We also don't spend a lot of time there, a total of maybe 3%, but the calculation logic it performs is invaluable.</p>

<p>Can I somehow call the 32bit DLLs from 64bit code?  MSDN suggests that I can't, period.  I've done some simple hacking and verified this.  Everything throws an invalid entry point exception.  The only possible solution i've found so far is to create COM+ wrappers for all of the 32bit DLL functions and invoke COM from the 64bit process.  This seems like quite a headache.  We can also run the process in WoW emulation, but then the memory ceiling wouldn't be increased, capping at around 1.6gb.</p>

"<p>Not sure if this is possible or if I'm expressing correctly what I'm looking for, but I have the following piece of code in my library repeatedly and would like to practice some DRY. 
I have set of SQL Server tables that I'm querying based on a simple user-supplied search field ala Google. I'm using LINQ to compose the final query based on what's in the search string. I'm looking for a way to use generics and passed in lambda functions to create a reusable routine out of this: </p>

<pre><code>string[] arrayOfQueryTerms = getsTheArray();

var somequery = from q in dataContext.MyTable
                select q;

if (arrayOfQueryTerms.Length == 1)
{
    somequery = somequery.Where&lt;MyTableEntity&gt;(
        e =&gt; e.FieldName.StartsWith(arrayOfQueryTerms[0]));
}
else
{
    foreach(string queryTerm in arrayOfQueryTerms)
    {
        if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(queryTerm))
        {
            somequery = somequery 
                        .Where&lt;MyTableEntity&gt;(

<pre><code>private IQueryable&lt;T&gt; getQuery(
    T MyTableEntity, string[] arrayOfQueryTerms, Func&lt;T, bool&gt; predicate)
</code></pre>

<p>I'm using the same search strategy across all my tables, so the only thing that really differs from usage to usage is the MyTable &amp; MyTableEntity searched and the FieldName searched. Does this make sense? Is there a way with LINQ to dynamically pass in the name of the field to query in the where clause? Or can I pass in this as a predicate lambda?</p>

<pre><code>e =&gt; e.FieldName.Contains(queryTerm)

"<p>Right now, we are using Perforce for version control. It has the handy feature of a strictly increasing change number that we can use to refer to builds, eg ""you'll get the bugfix if your build is at least 44902"".</p>

<p>I'd like to switch over to using a distributed system (probably git) to make it easier to branch and to work from home. (Both of which are perfectly possible with Perforce, but the git workflow has some advantages.)

"<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I am writing and using a very simple CGI-based (Perl) content management tool for two pro-bono websites. It provides the website administrator with HTML forms for events where they fill the fields (date, place, title, description, links, etc.) and save it. On that form I allow the administrator to upload an image related to the event. On the HTML page displaying the form, I am also showing a preview of the picture uploaded (HTML img tag).</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>The problem happens when the administrator wants to change the picture. He would just have to hit the ""browse"" button, pick a new picture and press ok. And this works fine.</p>

<p>Once the image is uploaded, my back-end CGI handles the upload and reloads the form properly.</p>

<p>The problem is that the image shown <strong>does not</strong> get refreshed. The old image is still shown, even though the database holds the right image. I have narrowed it down to the fact that the IMAGE IS CACHED in the web browser. If the administrator hits the RELOAD button in Firefox/Explorer/Safari, everything gets refreshed fine and the new image just appears.</p>

<h2>My Solution - Not Working</h2>

<p>I am trying to control the cache by writing a HTTP Expires instruction with a date very far in the past.</p>

<pre><code>Expires: Mon, 15 Sep 2003 1:00:00 GMT
</code></pre>

<p>Remember that I am on the administrative side and I don't really care if the pages takes a little longer to load because they are always expired.</p>

<p>But, this does not work either.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>When uploading an image, its filename is not kept in the database. It is renamed as <strong>Image.jpg</strong> (to simply things out when using it). When replacing the existing image with a new one, the name doesn't change either. Just the content of the image file changes.</p>

<p>The webserver is provided by the hosting service/ISP. It uses Apache.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>Is there a way to force the web browser to NOT cache things from this page, not even images?</p>

<p>I am juggling with the option to actually ""save the filename"" with the database. This way, if the image is changed, the src of the IMG tag will also change. However, this requires a lot of changes throughout the site and I rather not do it if I have a better solution. Also, this will still not work if the new image uploaded has the same name (say the image is photoshopped a bit and re-uploaded).</p>

I also have another Java app that does the same thing but instead writes on the file. What I want is to be able to run these apps at the same time so the scenario goes like this. ReadApp lists the folder and finds files A, B, C. It opens file A and starts the reading. WriteApp lists the folder and finds files A, B, C. It opens file A, sees that is is open (by an exception or whatever way) and goes to file B. ReadApp finishes file A and continues to B. It sees that it is open and continues to C. It is crucial that WriteApp doesn't write while ReadApp is reading the same file or vice versa. They are different processes.</p>

"<p>I'm relatively new to Mercurial and my team is trying it out right now as a replacement for Subversion.  </p>

<p>How can I commit and push a single file out to another repository while leaving other modifications in my working directory uncommitted (or at least not pushed to the other repository)?</p>

<p>This happens for us with database migrations.  We want to commit the migration to source control so a DBA can view and edit it while we're working on the code modifications to go along with that database migration.  The changes aren't yet ready to go so we don't want to push all of them out.</p>

<p>In subversion, I'd simply do:</p>

<pre><code>svn add my_migration.sql  
# commit only the migration, but not the other files I'm working on
svn commit -m ""migration notes"" my_mygration.sql
</code></pre>

<p>and continue working locally.</p>

<p>This doesn't work with mercurial as when I'm pushing it out to the other repository, if there are changes to it that I haven't pulled down, it wants me to pull them down, merge them, and commit that merge to the repository.  Commits after a merge don't allow you to omit files so it forces you to commit everything in your local repository.</p>

<p>The easiest thing that I can figure out is to commit the file to my local repository, clone my local repository, fetch any new changes from the actual repository, merge them and commit that merge, and them push my changes out.</p>

<pre><code>hg add my_migration.sql 
hg commit -m ""migration notes"" my_migration.sql 
cd ..
hg clone project project-clone
cd project-clone
hg fetch http://hg/project
hg push  http://hg/project
</code></pre>

<p>This works, but it feels like I'm missing something easier, some way to tell mercurial to ignore the files already in my working directory, just do the merge and send the files along.  I suspect mercurial queues can do this, but I don't fully grok mq yet.</p>

<p>Thanks to Josh Matthews below, the shelve command is exactly what I'm looking for.  I didn't see any great install instructions with some googling, so here is the combined stuff I used to get it working:</p>

<p>Get it with:</p>

<pre><code>hg clone http://freehg.org/u/tksoh/hgshelve/ hgshelve
</code></pre>

<p>The only file (currently) in the project is the hgshelve.py file.</p>

<p>Modify your ~/.hgrc to add the shelve extension, pointing to where you cloned the repo:</p>

<pre><code>[extensions] 
hgshelve=/Users/ted/Documents/workspace/hgshelve/hgshelve.py
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can <code>hg shelve</code> and <code>hg unshelve</code> to temporarily store changes away.  It lets you work at the ""patch hunk"" level to pick and choose the items to shelve away. It didn't appear to shelve a file had listed for adding, only files already in the repo with modifications.</p>

<p>As for stack (procedure-level) variables, my tests are showing that unitialized booleans are true, unitialized integers are 2129993264, and uninialized objects are just invalid pointers (i.e. not nil).  I'm guessing the norm is to always set procedure-level variables before accessing them?</p>

"<p>I deploy a webapp on two different containers (Tomcat and Jetty), but their default servlets for serving the static content have a different way of handling the URL structure I want to use (<a href=""http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=42411"">details</a>).</p>

<p>I am therefore looking to include a small servlet in the webapp to serve its own static content (images, CSS, etc.). The servlet should have the following properties:</p>

<ul>
<li>No external dependencies</li>
<li>Simple and reliable</li>
<li>Support for <a href=""http://www.freesoft.org/CIE/RFC/1945/58.htm""><code>If-Modified-Since</code></a> header (i.e. custom <a href=""http://java.sun.com/j2ee/1.4/docs/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServlet.html#getLastModified%28javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest%29""><code>getLastModified</code></a> method)</li>
<li>(Optional) support for gzip encoding, etags,...</li>
</ul>

<p>Is such a servlet available somewhere? The closest I can find is <a href=""http://www.unix.org.ua/orelly/java-ent/servlet/ch04_04.htm#ch04-35758"">example 4-10</a> from the servlet book.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> The URL structure I want to use - in case you are wondering - is simply:</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>    &lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
            &lt;servlet-name&gt;main&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
            &lt;url-pattern&gt;/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
    &lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;
    &lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
            &lt;servlet-name&gt;default&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
            &lt;url-pattern&gt;/static/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
    &lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So all requests should be passed to the main servlet, unless they are for the <code>static</code> path. The problem is that Tomcat's default servlet does not take the ServletPath into account (so it looks for the static files in the main folder), while Jetty does (so it looks in the <code>static</code> folder).</p>

I first thought <code>typeof()</code> would be my function, because I thought ""Hey, I only want to catch <code>FormatException</code> because that's the only thing I expect"". But that's not how <code>catch()</code> works: catch also catches all derived exceptions. After thinking about it, this is really obvious: Otherwise, <code>catch(Exception ex)</code> would not work!

"<p>Is there a way to tell if an event handler has been added to an object?  I'm serializing a list of objects into/out of session state so we can use SQL based session state... When an object in the list has a property changed it needs to be flagged, which the event handler took care of properly before.  However now when the objects are deserialized it isn't getting the event handler.</p>

<p>In an fit of mild annoyance, I just added the event handler to the Get property that accesses the object.  It's getting called now which is great, except that it's getting called like 5 times so I think the handler just keeps getting added every time the object is accessed.</p>

"<p>So why exactly is it that it's always recommended to use const as often as possible?  It seems to me that using const can be more of a pain than a help in C++.

<ol>
<li><p>It seems like every time I mark something as const, I get an error and have to change some other function somewhere to be const too.  Then this causes me to have to change <em>another</em> function somewhere else.  Is this something that just gets easier with experience?</p></li>
<li><p>Are the benefits of using const <em>really</em> enough to compensate for the trouble?  If you don't intend on changing an object, why not just not write code that doesn't change it?</p></li>

"<p>I understand benefits of dependency injection itself. Let's take Spring for instance. I also understand benefits of other Spring featureslike AOP, helpers of different kinds, etc. I'm just wondering, what are the benefits of XML configuration such as:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;bean id=""Mary"" class=""foo.bar.Female""&gt;
  &lt;property name=""age"" value=""23""/&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;
&lt;bean id=""John"" class=""foo.bar.Male""&gt;
  &lt;property name=""girlfriend"" ref=""Mary""/&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>compared to plain old java code such as:</p>

<pre><code>Female mary = new Female();
mary.setAge(23);
Male john = new Male();
john.setGirlfriend(mary);
</code></pre>

<p>which is easier debugged, compile time checked and can be understood by anyone who knows only java.
So what is the main purpose of a dependency injection framework? (or a piece of code that shows its benefits.)</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong><br/>
In case of</p>

<pre><code>IService myService;// ...
public void doSomething() {  
  myService.fetchData();
}
</code></pre>

<p>How can IoC framework guess which implementation of myService I want to be injected if there is more than one? If there is only one implementation of given interface, and I let IoC container automatically decide to use it, it will be broken after a second implementation appears. And if there is intentionally only one possible implementation of an interface then you do not need to inject it.</p>

<p>It would be really interesting to see small piece of configuration for IoC which shows it's benefits. I've been using Spring for a while and I can not provide such example. And I can show single lines which demonstrate benefits of hibernate, dwr, and other frameworks which I use.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong><br/>
I realize that IoC configuration can be changed without recompiling. Is it really such a good idea? I can understand when someone wants to change DB credentials without recompiling - he may be not developer. In your practice, how often someone else other than developer changes IoC configuration? I think that for developers there is no effort to recompile that particular class instead of changing configuration. And for non-developer you would probably want to make his life easier and provide some simpler configuration file.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 3:</strong><br/></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>External configuration of mapping between interfaces and their concrete implementations </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is so good in making it extenal? You don't make all your code external, while you definitely can - just place it in ClassName.java.txt file, read and compile manually on the fly - wow, you avoided recompiling. Why should compiling be avoided?!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You save coding time because you provide mappings declaratively, not in a procedural code </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand that sometimes declarative approach saves time. For example, I declare only once a mapping between a bean property and a DB column and hibernate uses this mapping while loading, saving, building SQL based on HSQL, etc. This is where the declarative approach works. In case of Spring (in my example), declaration had more lines and had the same expressiveness as corresponding code. If there is an example when such declaration is shorter than code - I would like to see it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Inversion of Control principle allows for easy unit testing because you can replace real implementations with fake ones (like replacing SQL database with an in-memory one)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do understand inversion of control benefits (I prefer to call the design pattern discussed here as Dependency Injection, because IoC is more general - there are many kinds of control, and we are inverting only one of them - control of initialization). I was asking why someone ever needs something other than a programming language for it. I definitely can replace real implementations with fake ones using code. And this code will express same thing as configuration - it will just initialize fields with fake values.</p>

<pre><code>mary = new FakeFemale();
</code></pre>

<p>I do understand benefits of DI. I do not understand what benefits are added by external XML configuration compared to configuring code that does the same. I do not think that compiling should be avoided - I compile every day and I'm still alive. I think configuration of DI is bad example of declarative approach. Declaration can be useful if is declared once AND is used many times in different ways - like hibernate cfg, where mapping between bean property and DB column is used for saving, loading, building search queries, etc. Spring DI configuration can be easily translated to configuring code, like in the beginning of this question, can it not? And it is used only for bean initialization, isn't it? Which means a declarative approach does not add anything here, does it?</p>

<p>When I declare hibernate mapping, I just give hibernate some information, and it works based on it - I do not tell it what to do. In case of spring, my declaration tells spring exactly wht to do - so why declare it, why not just do it?</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><strong>LAST UPDATE:</strong><br/>
Guys, a lot of answers are telling me about dependency injection, which I KNOW IS GOOD.
The question is about purpose of DI configuration instead of initializing code - I tend to think that initializing code is shorter and clearer.
The only answer I got so far to my question, is that it avoids recompiling, when the configuration changes. I guess I should post another question, because it is a big secret for me, why compiling should be avoided in this case.</p>

"<p>This question is not so much programming related as it is deployment related.</p>

<p>I find myself conversing a lot with the group in my company whose job it is to maintain our production Windows servers and deploy our code on them. For legal and compliance reasons, I do not have direct visibility or any control over the servers so the only way I can tell which version(s) of .NET are installed on any of them is through directions I give to that group. </p>

<p>So far, all of the methods I can think of to tell which version(s) are installed (check for Administrative Tools matching 1.1 or 2.0, check for the entries in the ""Add/Remove Programs"" list, check for the existence of the directories under c:\Windows\Microsoft.NET) are flawed (I've seen at least one machine with 2.0 but no 2.0 entries under Administrative Tools - and that method tells you nothing about 3.0+, the ""Add/Remove Programs"" list can get out of sync with reality, and the existence of the directories doesn't necessarily mean anything).</p>

<p>Given that I generally need to know these things are in place in advance (discovering that ""oops, this one doesn't have all the versions and service packs you need"" doesn't really work well with short maintenance windows) and I have to do the checking ""by proxy"" since I can't get on the servers directly, what's the foolproof way to tell which version(s) of .NET are installed on a production Windows Server? Preferably some intrinsic way to do so using what the framework installs since it will be quicker and not need some sort of utility to be loaded and also a method which will definitely fail if the frameworks are not properly installed but still have files in place (i.e., there's a directory and gacutil.exe is inded there but that version of the framework is not really ""installed"")</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> In the absence of a good foolproof intrinsic way to do this built into the Framework(s), does anyone know of a good, lightweight, no-install-required program that can find this out?

"<p>I just came across an interesting situation in Javascript.  I have a class with a method that defines several objects using object-literal notation.  Inside those objects, the <code>this</code> pointer is being used.  From the behavior of the program, I have deduced that the <code>this</code> pointer is referring to the class on which the method was invoked, and not the object being created by the literal.  This seems arbitrary, though it is the way I would expect it to work.  Is this defined behavior?  Is it cross-browser safe?  Is there any reasoning underlying why it is the way it is beyond ""the spec says so"" (for instance, is it a consequence of some broader design decision/philosophy)?  Pared-down code example:</p>

<pre><code>// inside class definition, itself an object literal, we have this function:
onRender: function() {

	this.menuItems = this.menuItems.concat([
		{
			text: 'Group by Module',
			rptletdiv: this
		},
		{
			text: 'Group by Status',
			rptletdiv: this
		}]);

"<p>In order to improve performance reading from a file, I'm trying to read the entire content of a big (several MB) file into memory and then use a istringstream to access the information.</p>

<p>My question is, which is the best way to read this information and ""import it"" into the string stream? A problem with this approach (see bellow) is that when creating the string stream the buffers gets copied, and memory usage doubles.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;fstream&gt;
#include &lt;sstream&gt;

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ifstream is;
  is.open (sFilename.c_str(), ios::binary );

  // get length of file:
  is.seekg (0, std::ios::end);
  long length = is.tellg();
  is.seekg (0, std::ios::beg);

  // allocate memory:
  char *buffer = new char [length];

  // read data as a block:
  is.read (buffer,length);

  // create string stream of memory contents
  // NOTE: this ends up copying the buffer!!!
  istringstream iss( string( buffer ) );

  // delete temporary buffer
  delete [] buffer;

  // close filestream
  is.close();

  /* ==================================
   * Use iss to access data

"<p>I realize that parameterized SQL queries is the optimal way to sanitize user input when building queries that contain user input, but I'm wondering what is wrong with taking user input and escaping any single quotes and surrounding the whole string with single quotes.  Here's the code:</p>

<pre><code>sSanitizedInput = ""'"" &amp; Replace(sInput, ""'"", ""''"") &amp; ""'""
</code></pre>

<p>Any single-quote the user enters is replaced with double single-quotes, which eliminates the users ability to end the string, so anything else they may type, such as semicolons, percent signs, etc, will all be part of the string and not actually executed as part of the command.  We are using Microsoft SQL Server 2000, for which I believe the single-quote is the only string delimiter and the only way to escape the string delimiter, so there is no way to execute anything the user types in.</p>

<p>I don't see any way to launch an SQL injection attack against this, but I realize that if this were as bulletproof as it seems to me someone else would have thought of it already and it would be common practice.  My question is this: what's wrong with this code?  Does anybody know a way to get an SQL injection attack past this sanitization technique?  Sample user input that exploits this technique would be very helpful.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone for their answers; pretty much all the information I came across in my research showed up on this page somewhere, which is a sign of the intelligence and skill of the people who have taken time out of their busy days to help me out with this question.  </p>

<p>The reason I have not yet accepted any of the answers is that I still don't know of any way to effectively launch a SQL injection attack against this code.  A few people suggested that a backslash would escape one single-quote and leave the other to end the string so that the rest of the string would be executed as part of the SQL command, and I realize that this method would work to inject SQL into a mySQL database, but in MS SQL 2000 the only way (that I've been able to find) to escape a single-quote is with another single-qoute; backslashes won't do it.  And unless there is a way to stop the escaping of the single-quote, none of the rest of the user input will be executed because it will all be taken as one contiguous string.</p>

<p>I understand that there are better ways to sanitize input but I'm really more interested in learning why the method I provided above won't work.  If anyone knows of any specific way to mount a SQL injection attack against this sanitization method I would love to see it.</p>

"<p>Designing a new system from scratch.  I'll be using the STL to store lists and maps of certain long-live objects.</p>

"<p>I'm trying to grok the purpose of .NET's SecureString.  From MSDN:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An instance of the System.String class is both immutable and, when no longer needed, cannot be programmatically scheduled for garbage collection; that is, the instance is read-only after it is created and it is not possible to predict when the instance will be deleted from computer memory. Consequently, if a String object contains sensitive information such as a password, credit card number, or personal data, there is a risk the information could be revealed after it is used because your application cannot delete the data from computer memory.</p>
  
  <p>A SecureString object is similar to a String object in that it has a text value. However, the value of a SecureString object is automatically encrypted, can be modified until your application marks it as read-only, and can be deleted from computer memory by either your application or the .NET Framework garbage collector.</p>
  
  <p>The value of an instance of SecureString is automatically encrypted when the instance is initialized or when the value is modified. Your application can render the instance immutable and prevent further modification by invoking the MakeReadOnly method.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is the automatic encryption the big payoff? </p>

<p>And why can't I just say:</p>

"<p>I'm currently primarily a D programmer and am looking to add another language to my toolbox, preferably one that supports the metaprogramming hacks that just can't be done in a statically compiled language like D.  I've read up on Lisp a little and I would love to find a language that allows some of the cool stuff that Lisp does, but without the strange syntax, etc. of Lisp.  I don't want to start a language flame war, and I'm sure both Ruby and Python have their tradeoffs, so I'll list what's important to me personally.  Please tell me whether Ruby, Python, or some other language would be best for me.</p>

<p>Important:</p>

<ol>
<li>Good metaprogramming.  Ability to create classes, methods, functions, etc. at runtime.  Preferably, minimal distinction between code and data, Lisp style.</li>
<li>Nice, clean, sane syntax and consistent, intuitive semantics.  Basically a well thought-out, fun to use, modern language.</li>
<li>Multiple paradigms.  No one paradigm is right for every project, or even every small subproblem within a project.</li>
<li>An interesting language that actually affects the way one thinks about programming.</li>
</ol>

<p>Somewhat important:</p>

<ol>
<li>Performance.  It would be nice if performance was decent, but when performance is a real priority, I'll use D instead.</li>
<li>Well-documented.  </li>
</ol>

<p>Not important:</p>

<ol>
<li>Community size, library availability, etc.  None of these are characteristics of the language itself, and all can change very quickly.</li>
<li>Job availability.  I am not a full-time, professional programmer.  I am a grad student and programming is tangentially relevant to my research.</li>

<p>When it comes time to compare the actual output to the expected output I'm running into some problems.  My first thought was just to do string comparisons on the expected and actual messages.

"<p>I have a scenario. (Windows Forms, C#, .NET)</p>

<ol>
<li>There is a main form which hosts some user control.</li>
<li>The user control does some heavy data operation, such that if I directly call the <code>UserControl_Load</code> method the UI become nonresponsive for the duration for load method execution.</li>
<li>To overcome this I load data on different thread (trying to change existing code as little as I can)  </li>
<li>I used a background worker thread which will be loading the data and when done will notify the application that it has done its work.  </li>
<li>Now came a real problem. All the UI (main form and its child usercontrols) was created on the primary main thread. In the LOAD method of the usercontrol I'm fetching data based on the values of some control (like textbox) on userControl. </li>
</ol>

<p>The pseudocode would look like this:</p>

<p><strong>CODE 1</strong></p>

<pre><code>UserContrl1_LoadDataMethod()
{
    if (textbox1.text == ""MyName"") // This gives exception
    {
        //Load data corresponding to ""MyName"".
        //Populate a globale variable List&lt;string&gt; which will be binded to grid at some later stage.
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The Exception it gave was</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cross-thread operation not valid: Control accessed from a thread other than the thread it was created on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To know more about this I did some googling and a suggestion came up like using the following code</p>

<p><strong>CODE 2</strong></p>

<pre><code>UserContrl1_LoadDataMethod()
{
    if (InvokeRequired) // Line #1
    {
        this.Invoke(new MethodInvoker(UserContrl1_LoadDataMethod));
        return;
    }

    if (textbox1.text == ""MyName"") // Now it wont give an exception
    {
    //Load data correspondin to ""MyName""
        //Populate a globale variable List&lt;string&gt; which will be binded to grid at some later stage
    }
}

<p>BUT BUT BUT... it seems I'm back to square one. The Application again 
become nonresponsive. It seems to be due to the execution of line #1 if condition. The loading task is again done by the parent thread and not the third that I spawned.</p>

<p>How do I resolve this and also what is the effect of execution of Line#1 if block?</p>

<p>Most of the projects compile to static libraries, this makes testing easier since each one also has a set of associated unit tests. It seems the use of static libraries prevents VS2005 from using incremental linking, so even with incremental linking turned on it does a full link every time.</p>

"<p>I was asked to do a code review and report on the feasibility of adding a new feature to one of our new products, one that I haven't personally worked on until now. I know it's easy to nitpick someone else's code, but I'd say it's in bad shape (while trying to be as objective as possible). Some highlights from my code review:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Abuse of threads:</strong> <code>QueueUserWorkItem</code> and threads in general are used <em>a lot</em>, and Thread-pool delegates have uninformative names such as <code>PoolStart</code> and <code>PoolStart2</code>. There is also a lack of proper synchronization between threads, in particular accessing UI objects on threads other than the UI thread.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Magic numbers and magic strings</strong>: Some <code>Const</code>'s and <code>Enum</code>'s are defined in the code, but much of the code relies on literal values.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Global variables</strong>: Many variables are declared global and may or may not be initialized depending on what code paths get followed and what order things occur in. This gets very confusing when the code is also jumping around between threads.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Compiler warnings</strong>: The main solution file contains 500+ warnings, and the total number is unknown to me. I got a warning from Visual Studio that it couldn't display any more warnings.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Half-finished classes</strong>: The code was worked on and added to here and there, and I think this led to people forgetting what they had done before, so there are a few seemingly half-finished classes and empty stubs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Not Invented Here</strong>: The product duplicates functionality that already exists in common libraries used by other products, such as data access helpers, error logging helpers, and user interface helpers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Separation of concerns</strong>: I think someone was holding the book upside down when they read about the typical ""UI -> business layer -> data access layer"" 3-tier architecture. In this codebase, the UI layer directly accesses the database, because the business layer is partially implemented but mostly ignored due to not being fleshed out fully enough, and the data access layer controls the UI layer. Most of the low-level database and network methods operate on a global reference to the main form, and directly show, hide, and modify the form. Where the rather thin business layer <em>is</em> actually used, it also tends to control the UI directly. Most of this lower-level code also uses <code>MessageBox.Show</code> to display error messages when an exception occurs, and most swallow the original exception. This of course makes it a bit more complicated to start writing units tests to verify the functionality of the program before attempting to refactor it.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I'm just scratching the surface here, but my question is simple enough: Would it make more sense to take the time to refactor the existing codebase, focusing on one issue at a time, or would you consider rewriting the entire thing from scratch?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: To clarify a bit, we do have the original requirements for the project, which is why starting over could be an option. Another way to phrase my question is: Can code ever reach a point where the cost of maintaining it would become greater than the cost of dumping it and starting over?</p>

"<p>I work with a lot of web applications that are driven by databases of varying complexity on the backend. Typically, there's an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping"">ORM</a> layer separate from the business and presentation logic. This makes unit-testing the business logic fairly straightforward; things can be implemented in discrete modules and any data needed for the test can be faked through object mocking.</p>

<p>But testing the ORM and database itself has always been fraught with problems and compromises. </p>

<p>Over the years, I have tried a few strategies, none of which completely satisfied me.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Load a test database with known data. Run tests against the ORM and confirm that the right data comes back. The disadvantage here is that your test DB has to keep up with any schema changes in the application database, and might get out of sync. It also relies on artificial data, and may not expose bugs that occur due to stupid user input. Finally, if the test database is small, it won't reveal inefficiencies like a missing index. (OK, that last one isn't really what unit testing should be used for, but it doesn't hurt.)</p></li>
<li><p>Load a copy of the production database and test against that. The problem here is that you may have no idea what's in the production DB at any given time; your tests may need to be rewritten if data changes over time. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Some people have pointed out that both of these strategies rely on specific data, and a unit test should test only functionality. To that end, I've seen suggested:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use a mock database server, and check only that the ORM is sending the correct queries in response to a given method call.</li>

>>> help(funny_function)
Help on function funny_function in module __main__:

funny_function(*args, **kwargs)
    Computes x*y + 2*z
</pre>

<p>But there is still a problem: the function signature is wrong. The information ""*args, **kwargs"" is next to useless.</p>

<p>What to do? I can think of two simple but flawed workarounds:</p>

<p>1 -- Include the correct signature in the docstring:</p>

<pre>
def funny_function(x, y, z=3):
    """"""funny_function(x, y, z=3) -- computes x*y + 2*z""""""
    return x*y + 2*z
</pre>

<p>This is bad because of the duplication. The signature will still not be shown properly in automatically generated documentation. It's easy to update the function and forget about changing the docstring, or to make a typo. [<i>And yes, I'm aware of the fact that the docstring already duplicates the function body. Please ignore this; funny_function is just a random example.</i>]</p>

<p>2 -- Not use a decorator, or use a special-purpose decorator for every specific signature:</p>

<pre>
def funny_functions_decorator(f):
    def g(x, y, z=3):
        return f(int(x), int(y), z=int(z))
    g.__name__ = f.__name__
    g.__doc__ = f.__doc__
    return g
</pre>

<p>This works fine for a set of functions that have identical signature, but it's useless in general. As I said in the beginning, I want to be able to use decorators entirely generically.</p>

<p>I'm looking for a solution that is fully general, and automatic.</p>

<p>So the question is: is there a way to edit the decorated function signature after it has been created?</p>

<p>Otherwise, can I write a decorator that extracts the function signature and uses that information instead of ""*kwargs, **kwargs"" when constructing the decorated function? How do I extract that information? How should I construct the decorated function -- with exec?</p>

<p>Any other approaches?</p>

"<p>This is an issue that I've spent hours researching in the past.  It seems to me to be something that should have been addressed by modern <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational%5Fdatabase%5Fmanagement%5Fsystem"">RDBMS</a> solutions but as yet I have not found anything that really addresses what I see to be an incredibly common need in any Web or Windows application with a database back-end.</p>

<p>I speak of dynamic sorting.  In my fantasy world, it should be as simple as something like:</p>

<pre><code>ORDER BY @sortCol1, @sortCol2
</code></pre>

<p>This is the canonical example given by newbie SQL and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stored%5Fprocedure"">Stored Procedure</a> developers all over forums across the Internet.  ""Why isn't this possible?"" they ask.  Invariably, somebody eventually comes along to lecture them about the compiled nature of stored procedures, of execution plans in general, and all sorts of other reasons why it isn't possible to put a parameter directly into an <code>ORDER BY</code> clause.</p>

<hr>

<p>I know what some of you are already thinking:  ""Let the client do the sorting, then.""  Naturally, this offloads the work from your database.  In our case though, our database servers aren't even breaking a sweat 99% of the time and they aren't even multi-core yet or any of the other myriad improvements to system architecture that happen every 6 months.  For this reason alone, having our databases handle sorting wouldn't be a problem.  Additionally, databases are <em>very</em> good at sorting.  They are optimized for it and have had years to get it right, the language for doing it is incredibly flexible, intuitive, and simple and above all any beginner SQL writer knows how to do it and even more importantly they know how to edit it, make changes, do maintenance, etc.  When your databases are far from being taxed and you just want to simplify (and shorten!) development time this seems like an obvious choice.</p>

<p>Then there's the web issue.  I've played around with JavaScript that will do client-side sorting of HTML tables, but they inevitably aren't flexible enough for my needs and, again, since my databases aren't overly taxed and can do sorting really <em>really</em> easily, I have a hard time justifying the time it would take to re-write or roll-my-own JavaScript sorter.  The same generally goes for server-side sorting, though it is already probably much preferred over JavaScript.  I'm not one that particularly likes the overhead of DataSets, so sue me.</p>

<p>But this brings back the point that it isn't possible &mdash; or rather, not easily.  I've done, with prior systems, an incredibly hack way of getting dynamic sorting.  It wasn't pretty, nor intuitive, simple, or flexible and a beginner SQL writer would be lost within seconds.  Already this is looking to be not so much a ""solution"" but a ""complication.""</p>

<p>The following examples are not meant to expose any sort of best practices or good coding style or anything, nor are they indicative of my abilities as a T-SQL programmer.  They are what they are and I fully admit they are confusing, bad form, and just plain hack.</p>

<p>We pass an integer value as a parameter to a stored procedure (let's call the parameter just ""sort"") and from that we determine a bunch of other variables.  For example... let's say sort is 1 (or the default):</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @sortCol1 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @sortCol2 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @dir1 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @dir2 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @col1 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @col2 AS varchar(20)

SET @col1 = 'storagedatetime';
SET @col2 = 'vehicleid';

IF @sort = 1                -- Default sort.
BEGIN
    SET @sortCol1 = @col1;
    SET @dir1 = 'asc';
    SET @sortCol2 = @col2;
    SET @dir2 = 'asc';
END
ELSE IF @sort = 2           -- Reversed order default sort.
BEGIN
    SET @sortCol1 = @col1;
    SET @dir1 = 'desc';
    SET @sortCol2 = @col2;
    SET @dir2 = 'desc';
END
</code></pre>

<p>You can already see how if I declared more @colX variables to define other columns I could really get creative with the columns to sort on based on the value of ""sort""... to use it, it usually ends up looking like the following incredibly messy clause:</p>

<pre><code>ORDER BY
    CASE @dir1
        WHEN 'desc' THEN
            CASE @sortCol1
                WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime]
                WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid]
            END
    END DESC,
    CASE @dir1
        WHEN 'asc' THEN
            CASE @sortCol1
                WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime]
                WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid]
            END
    END,
    CASE @dir2
        WHEN 'desc' THEN
            CASE @sortCol2
                WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime]
                WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid]
            END
    END DESC,
    CASE @dir2
        WHEN 'asc' THEN
            CASE @sortCol2
                WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime]
                WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid]
            END
    END
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously this is a very stripped down example.  The real stuff, since we usually have four or five columns to support sorting on, each with possible secondary or even a third column to sort on in addition to that (for example date descending then sorted secondarily by name ascending) and each supporting bi-directional sorting which effectively doubles the number of cases.  Yeah... it gets hairy really quick.</p>

<p>The idea is that one could ""easily"" change the sort cases such that vehicleid gets sorted before the storagedatetime... but the pseudo-flexibility, at least in this simple example, really ends there.  Essentially, each case that fails a test (because our sort method doesn't apply to it this time around) renders a NULL value.  And thus you end up with a clause that functions like the following:</p>

<pre><code>ORDER BY NULL DESC, NULL, [storagedatetime] DESC, blah blah
</code></pre>

<p>You get the idea.  It works because SQL Server effectively ignores null values in order by clauses.  This is incredibly hard to maintain, as anyone with any basic working knowledge of SQL can probably see.  If I've lost any of you, don't feel bad.  It took us a long time to get it working and we still get confused trying to edit it or create new ones like it.  Thankfully it doesn't need changing often, otherwise it would quickly become ""not worth the trouble.""</p>

<p>Yet it <em>did</em> work.</p>

<hr>

<p>My question is then:  <strong>is there a better way?</strong></p>

<p>I'm okay with solutions other than Stored Procedure ones, as I realize it may just not be the way to go.  Preferably, I'd like to know if anyone can do it better within the Stored Procedure, but if not, how do you all handle letting the user dynamically sort tables of data (bi-directionally, too) with ASP.NET?</p>

<p>And thank you for reading (or at least skimming) such a long question!</p>

<p>PS: Be glad I didn't show my example of a stored procedure that supports dynamic sorting, dynamic filtering/text-searching of columns, pagination via ROWNUMBER() OVER, <em>AND</em> try...catch with transaction rollbacking on errors... ""behemoth-sized"" doesn't even begin to describe them.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I would like to <strong>avoid dynamic SQL</strong>.  Parsing a string together and running an EXEC on it defeats a lot of the purpose of having a stored procedure in the first place.  Sometimes I wonder though if the cons of doing such a thing wouldn't be worth it, at least in these special dynamic sorting cases.  Still, I always feel dirty whenever I do dynamic SQL strings like that &mdash; like I'm still living in the Classic ASP world.</li>
<li>A lot of the reason we want stored procedures in the first place is for <strong>security</strong>.  I don't get to make the call on security concerns, only suggest solutions.  With SQL Server 2005 we can set permissions (on a per-user basis if need be) at the schema level on individual stored procedures and then deny any queries against the tables directly.  Critiquing the pros and cons of this approach is perhaps for another question, but again it's not my decision.  I'm just the lead code monkey. :)</li>

<p>I've found <A HREF=""http://www.codeproject.com/KB/system/VmDetect.aspx"">an article</A> with some useful information on the topic. The same article appears in multiple places, I'm unsure of the original source. <A HREF=""http://www.vmware.com/"">VMware</A> implements a particular invalid x86 instruction to return information about itself, while <A HREF=""http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/virtualpc/default.mspx"">VirtualPC</A> uses a magic number and I/O port with an IN instruction.</p>

"<p>I'm a contract programmer with lots of experience.  I'm used to being hired by a client to go in and do a software project of one form or another on my own, usually from nothing.  That means a clean slate, almost every time.  I can bring in libraries I've developed to get a quick start, but they're always optional. (and depend on getting the right IP clauses in the contract)  Many times I can specify or even design the <em>hardware</em> platform...  so we're talking serious freedom here.</p>

<p>I can see uses for constructing automated tests for certain code:  Libraries with more than trivial functionality, core functionality with a high number of references, etc.  Basically, as the value of a piece of code goes up through heavy use, I can see it would be more and more valuable to automatically test that code so that I know I don't break it.</p>

<p>However, <em>in my situation</em>, I find it hard to rationalize anything more than that.  I'll adopt things as they prove useful, but I'm not about to blindly follow anything.</p>

<p>I find many of the things I do in 'maintenance' are actually small design changes.  In this case, the tests would not have saved me anything and now they'd have to change too.  A highly iterative, stub-first design approach works very well for me.  I can't see actually saving myself that much time with more extensive tests.</p>

<p>Hobby projects are even harder to justify...  they're usually anything from weekenders up to a say month long.  Edge-case bugs rarely matter, it's all about playing with something.</p>

<p>Reading questions such as <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/67898/tdd-and-productivity"">this one</a>, The most voted on response seems to say that in that poster's experience/opinion TDD actually wastes time if you've got less than 5  people (even assuming a certain level of competence/experience with TDD).  However, that appears to be covering initial development time, not maintenance.  It's not clear how TDD stacks up over the entire life cycle of a project.</p>

<p>I think TDD could be a good step in the worthwhile goal of improving the quality of the products of our industry as a whole.  Idealism on it's own is no longer all that effective at motivating me, though.</p>

<p>I <em>do</em> think TDD would be a good approach in large teams, or any size team containing at least one unreliable programmer.  That's not my question.</p>

"<p>What I'd like is a method to convert a double to a string which rounds using the half-up method. I.e. if the decimal to be rounded is a 5, it always rounds up the previous number. This is the standard method of rounding most people expect in most situations.</p>

<p>I also would like only significant digits to be displayed. That is there should not be any trailing zeroes.</p>

<p>I know one method of doing this is to use the String.format method:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>returns:</p>

  value returned from a message to nil
  may also be valid:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>If the method returns an object, any pointer type, any integer scalar
  of size less than or equal to
  sizeof(void*), a float, a double, a
  long double, or a long long, then a
  message sent to nil returns 0.</li>
  <li>If the method returns a struct, as defined by the Mac OS X ABI Function
  Call Guide to be returned in
  registers, then a message sent to nil
  returns 0.0 for every field in the
  data structure. Other struct data
  types will not be filled with zeros.</li>
  <li>If the method returns anything other than the aforementioned value
  types the return value of a message

"<p>i know this is very much a ""how long is a piece of string"" type of question, however i have recently inherited a couple of applications that run as windows services, and i am having problems providing a gui (accessible from a context menu in system tray) with both of them.</p>

<p>before you ask, the reason why we need a gui for a windows service is in order to be able to re-configure the behaviour of the windows service(s) without resorting to stopping/re-starting.</p>

<p>my code works fine in debug mode, and i get the context menu come up, and everything behaves correctly etc.</p>

<p>when i install the service via ""installutil"" using a named account (i.e., not Local System Account), the service runs fine, but doesn't display the icon in the system tray (i know this is normal behaviour because i don't have the ""interact with desktop"" option).</p>

<p>here is the problem though - when i choose the ""LocalSystemAccount"" option, and check the ""interact with desktop"" option, the service takes AGES to start up for no obvious reason, and i just keep getting ""Could not start the ... service on Local Computer. Error 1053: the service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely fashion"".</p>

<p>incidentally, i increased the windows service timeout from the default 30 seconds to 2 minutes via a registry hack (see <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824344"">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824344</a>, search for TimeoutPeriod in section 3), however the service start up still times out.</p>

<p>my first question is - why might the ""Local System Account"" login takes SOOOOO MUCH LONGER than when the service logs in with the non-LocalSystemAccount, causing the windows service time-out? what's could the difference be between these two to cause such different behaviour at start up?</p>

<p>secondly - taking a step back, all i'm trying to achieve, is simply a windows service that provides a gui for configuration - I'd be quite happy to run using the non-Local System Account (with named user/pwd), if I could get the service to interact with the desktop (that is, have a context menu available from the system tray). is this possible, and if so how?</p>

"<p>I've been looking at F# recently, and while I'm not likely to leap the fence any time soon, it definitely highlights some areas where C# (or library support) could make life easier.</p>

<p>In particular, I'm thinking about the pattern matching capability of F#, which allows a very rich syntax - much more expressive than the current switch/conditional C# equivalents. I won't try to give a direct example (my F# isn't up to it), but in short it allows:</p>

<ul>
<li>match by type (with full-coverage checking for discriminated unions) [note this also infers the type for the bound variable, giving member access etc]</li>
<li>match by predicate</li>
<li>combinations of the above (and possibly some other scenarios I'm not aware of)</li>
</ul>

<p>While it would be lovely for C# to eventually borrow [ahem] some of this richness, in the interim I've been looking at what can be done at runtime - for example, it is fairly easy to knock together some objects to allow:</p>

<pre><code>var getRentPrice = new Switch&lt;Vehicle, int&gt;()
        .Case&lt;Motorcycle&gt;(bike =&gt; 100 + bike.Cylinders * 10) // ""bike"" here is typed as Motorcycle
        .Case&lt;Bicycle&gt;(30) // returns a constant
        .Case&lt;Car&gt;(car =&gt; car.EngineType == EngineType.Diesel, car =&gt; 220 + car.Doors * 20)
        .Case&lt;Car&gt;(car =&gt; car.EngineType == EngineType.Gasoline, car =&gt; 200 + car.Doors * 20)
        .ElseThrow(); // or could use a Default(...) terminator
</code></pre>

<p>where getRentPrice is a Func&lt;Vehicle,int&gt;.</p>

<p>[note - maybe Switch/Case here is the wrong terms... but it shows the idea]</p>

<p>To me, this is a lot clearer than the equivalent using repeated if/else, or a composite ternary conditional (which gets very messy for non-trivial expressions - brackets galore). It also avoids a <em>lot</em> of casting, and allows for simple extension (either directly or via extension methods) to more-specific matches, for example an InRange(...) match comparable to the VB Select...Case ""x To y"" usage.</p>

<p><strong>I'm just trying to gauge if people think there is much benefit from constructs like the above (in the absence of language support)?</strong></p>

<p>Note additionally that I've been playing with 3 variants of the above:</p>

<ul>
<li>a Func&lt;TSource,TValue&gt; version for evaluation - comparable to composite ternary conditional statements</li>
<li>an Action&lt;TSource&gt; version - comparable to if/else if/else if/else if/else</li>
<li>an Expression&lt;Func&lt;TSource,TValue&gt;&gt; version - as the first, but usable by arbitrary LINQ providers</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, using the Expression-based version enables Expression-tree re-writing, essentially inlining all the branches into a single composite conditional Expression, rather than using repeated invocation. I haven't checked recently, but in some early Entity Framework builds I seem to recall this being necessary, as it didn't like InvocationExpression very much. It also allows more efficient usage with LINQ-to-Objects, since it avoids repeated delegate invocations - tests show a match like the above (using the Expression form) performing at the same speed [marginally quicker, in fact] compared to the equivalent C# composite conditional statement. For completeness, the Func&lt;...&gt; based-version took 4 times as long as the C# conditional statement, but is still very quick and is unlikely to be a major bottleneck in most use-cases.</p>

<p>I welcome any thoughts / input / critique / etc on the above (or on the possibilities of richer C# language support... here's hoping ;-p).</p>

"<p>As a follow up to a <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/151590/java-how-do-detect-a-remote-side-socket-close"">recent question</a>, I wonder why it is impossible in Java, without attempting reading/writing on a TCP socket, to detect that the socket has been gracefully closed by the peer? This seems to be the case regardless of whether one uses the pre-NIO <code>Socket</code> or the NIO <code>SocketChannel</code>.</p>

<p>When a peer gracefully closes a TCP connection, the TCP stacks on both sides of the connection know about the fact. The server-side (the one that initiates the shutdown) ends up in state <code>FIN_WAIT2</code>, whereas the client-side (the one that does not explicitly respond to the shutdown) ends up in state <code>CLOSE_WAIT</code>. Why isn't there a method in <code>Socket</code> or <code>SocketChannel</code> that can query the TCP stack to see whether the underlying TCP connection has been terminated? Is it that the TCP stack doesn't provide such status information? Or is it a design decision to avoid a costly call into the kernel?</p>

<p>With the help of the users who have already posted some answers to this question, I think I see where the issue might be coming from. The side that doesn't explicitly close the connection ends up in TCP state <code>CLOSE_WAIT</code> meaning that the connection is in the process of shutting down and waits for the side to issue its own <code>CLOSE</code> operation. I suppose it's fair enough that <code>isConnected</code> returns <code>true</code> and <code>isClosed</code> returns <code>false</code>, but why isn't there something like <code>isClosing</code>?</p>

<p>Below are the test classes that use pre-NIO sockets. But identical results are obtained using NIO.</p>

<pre><code>import java.net.ServerSocket;
import java.net.Socket;

public class MyServer {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    final ServerSocket ss = new ServerSocket(12345);
    final Socket cs = ss.accept();
    System.out.println(""Accepted connection"");
    Thread.sleep(5000);
    cs.close();
    System.out.println(""Closed connection"");
    ss.close();
    Thread.sleep(100000);
  }
}


import java.net.Socket;

public class MyClient {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    final Socket s = new Socket(""localhost"", 12345);
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {

"<p>The more we use RAII in C++, the more we find ourselves with destructors that do non-trivial deallocation. Now, deallocation (finalization, however you want to call it) can fail, in which case exceptions are really the only way to let anybody upstairs know of our deallocation problem. But then again, throwing-destructors are a bad idea because of the possibility of exceptions being thrown during stack unwinding. <code>std::uncaught_exception()</code> lets you know when that happens, but not much more, so aside from letting you log a message before termination there's not much you can do, unless you're willing to leave your program in an undefined state, where some stuff is deallocated/finalized and some not.</p>

<p>One approach is to have no-throw destructors. But in many cases that just hides a real error. Our destructor might, for example, be closing some RAII-managed DB connections as a result of some exception being thrown, and those DB connections might fail to close. This doesn't necessarily mean we're ok with the program terminating at this point. On the other hand, logging and tracing these errors isn't really a solution for every case; otherwise we would have had no need for exceptions to begin with. 
With no-throw destructors we also find ourselves having to create ""reset()"" functions that are supposed to be called before destruction - but that just defeats the whole purpose of RAII.</p>

<p>Another approach is just to <a href=""http://www.kolpackov.net/projects/c++/eh/dtor-1.xhtml"">let the program terminate</a>, as it's the most predictable thing you can do.</p>

<p>Some people suggest chaining exceptions, so that more than one error can be handled at a time. But I honestly never actually seen that done in C++ and I've no idea how to implement such a thing.</p>

<p>So it's either RAII or exceptions. Isn't it? I'm leaning toward no-throw destructors; mainly because it keeps things simple(r). But I really hope there's a better solution, because, as I said, the more we use RAII, the more we find ourselves using dtors that do non-trivial things.</p>

"<p>What options are there for serialization when returning instances of custom classes from a WebService?</p>

<p>We have some classes with a number of child collection class properties as well as other properties that may or may not be set depending on usage.  These objects are returned from an ASP.NET .asmx WebService decorated with the ScriptService attribute, so are serialized via JSON serialization when returned by the various WebMethods.</p>

<p>The problem is that the out of the box serialization returns all public properties, regardless of whether or not they are used, as well as returning class name and other information in a more verbose manner than would be desired if you wanted to limit the amount of traffic.</p>

<p>Currently, for the classes being returned we have added custom javascript converters that handle the JSON serializtion, and added them to the web.config as below:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;system.web.extensions&gt;
  &lt;scripting&gt;
    &lt;webServices&gt;
      &lt;jsonSerialization&gt;
        &lt;converters&gt;
          &lt;add name=""CustomClassConverter"" type=""Namespace.CustomClassConverter"" /&gt;
        &lt;/converters&gt;
      &lt;/jsonSerialization&gt;
    &lt;/webServices&gt;
  &lt;/scripting&gt;
&lt;/system.web.extensions&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But this requires a custom converter for each class.  Is there any other way to change the out of the box JSON serialization, either through extending the service, creating a custom serializer or the like?</p>

<p><b>Follow Up</b><br />
@<a href=""#159811"">marxidad</a>:</p>

<p>We are using the DataContractJsonSerializer class in other applications, however I have been unable to figure out how to apply it to these services.  Here's an example of how the services are set-up:</p>

<pre><code>[ScriptService]
public class MyService : System.Web.Services.WebService
{
    [WebMethod]
    public CustomClass GetCustomClassMethod
    {
        return new customClass();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The WebMethods are called by javascript and return data serialized in JSON.  The only method we have been able to change the serialization is to use the javascript converters as referenced above?  </p>

<p>Is there a way to tell the WebService to use a custom DataContractJsonSerializer?  Whether it be by web.config configuration, decorating the service with attributes, etc.? </p>

<p><b>Update</b><br />
Well, we couldn't find any way to switch the out of the box JavaScriptSerializer except for creating individual JavaScriptConverters as above.</p>

<p>What we did on that end to prevent having to create a separate converter was create a generic JavaScriptConverter.  We added an empty interface to the classes we wanted handled and the SupportedTypes which is called on web-service start-up uses reflection to find any types that implement the interface kind of like this:</p>

<pre><code>public override IEnumerable&lt;Type&gt; SupportedTypes
{
  get
  {
    foreach (Assembly assembly in AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies())
    {
      AssemblyBuilder dynamicAssemblyCheck = assembly as AssemblyBuilder;
      if (dynamicAssemblyCheck == null)
      {
        foreach (Type type in assembly.GetExportedTypes())
        {
          if (typeof(ICustomClass).IsAssignableFrom(type))
          {
            yield return type;
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The actual implementation is a bit different so that the type are cached, and we will likely refactor it to use custom attributes rather than an empty interface.</p>

<p>However with this, we ran into a slightly different problem when dealing with custom collections.  These typically just extend a generic list, but the custom classes are used instead of the List&lt;> itself because there is generally custom logic, sorting etc. in the collection classes.</p>

<p>The problem is that the Serialize method for a JavaScriptConverter returns a dictionary which is serialized into JSON as name value pairs with the associated type, whereas a list is returned as an array.  So the collection classes could not be easily serialized using the converter.  The solution for this was to just not include those types in the converter's SupportedTypes and they serialize perfectly as lists.</p>

<p>So, serialization works, but when you try to pass these objects the other way as a parameter for a web service call, the deserialization breaks, because they can't be the input is treated as a list of string/object dictionaries, which can't be converted to a list of whatever custom class the collection contains.  The only way we could find to deal with this is to create a generic class that is a list of string/object dictionaries which then converts the list to the appropriate custom collection class, and then changing any web service parameters to use the generic class instead.</p>

<p>I'm sure there are tons of issues and violations of ""best practices"" here, but it gets the job done for us without creating a ton of custom converter classes.</p>

"<p>This question may sound fairly elementary, but this is a debate I had with another developer I work with.</p>

<p>I was taking care to stack allocate things where I could, instead of heap allocating them. He was talking to me and watching over my shoulder and commented that it wasn't necessary because they are the same performance wise.</p>

<p>I was always under the impression that growing the stack was constant time, and heap allocation's performance depended on the current complexity of the heap for both allocation (finding a hole of the proper size) and de-allocating (collapsing holes to reduce fragmentation, as many standard library implementations take time to do this during deletes if I am not mistaken).</p>

<p>This strikes me as something that would probably be very compiler dependent.

"<p>I've noticed that just in the last year or so, many major websites have made the same change to the way their pages are structured. Each has moved their Javascript files from being hosted on the same domain as the page itself (or a subdomain of that), to being hosted on a differently named domain.</p>

<h2>It's not simply parallelization</h2>

<p>Now, there is a well known technique of spreading the components of your page across multiple domains to parallelize downloading.  <a href=""http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#split"" rel=""nofollow"">Yahoo recommends it</a> as do many others.  For instance, <strong>www.example.com</strong> is where your HTML is hosted, then you put images on <strong>images.example.com</strong> and javascripts on <strong>scripts.example.com</strong>. This gets around the fact that most browsers limit the number of simultaneous connections per server in order to be good net citizens.</p>

<p>The above is <em>not</em> what I am talking about.</p>

<h2>It's not simply redirection to a content delivery network (or maybe it is--see bottom of question)</h2>

<p>What I am talking about is hosting Javascripts specifically on an entirely different domain. Let me be specific. Just in the last year or so I've noticed that:</p>

<p><strong>youtube.com</strong> has moved its .JS files to <strong>ytimg.com</strong></p>

<p><strong>cnn.com</strong> has moved its .JS files to <strong>cdn.turner.com</strong></p>

<p><strong>weather.com</strong> has moved its .JS files to <strong>j.imwx.com</strong></p>

<p>Now, I know about content delivery networks like <a href=""http://www.akamai.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Akamai</a> who specialize in outsourcing this for large websites.  (The name ""cdn"" in Turner's special domain clues us in to the importance of this concept here).</p>

<p>But note with these examples, each site has its own specifically registered domain for this purpose, and its not the domain of a content delivery network or other infrastructure provider. In fact, if you try to load the home page off most of these script domains, they usually redirect back to the main domain of the company.  And if you reverse lookup the IPs involved, they <em>sometimes</em> appear point to a CDN company's servers, sometimes not.</p>

<h2>Why do I care?</h2>

<p>Having formerly worked at two different security companies, I have been made paranoid of malicious Javascripts.</p>

<p>As a result, I follow the practice of whitelisting sites that I will allow Javascript (and other active content such as Java) to run on. As a result, to make a site like <strong>cnn.com</strong> work properly, I have to manually put <strong>cnn.com</strong> into a list. It's a pain in the behind, but I prefer it over the alternative.</p>

<p>When folks used things like <strong>scripts.cnn.com</strong> to parallelize, that worked fine with appropriate wildcarding.  And when folks used subdomains off the CDN company domains, I could just permit the CDN company's main domain with a wildcard in front as well and kill many birds with one stone (such as *.edgesuite.net and *.akamai.com).</p>

<p>Now I have discovered that (as of 2008) this is not enough. Now I have to poke around in the source code of a page I want to whitelist, and figure out what ""secret"" domain (or domains) that site is using to store their Javascripts on.  In some cases I've found I have to permit three different domains to make a site work.</p>

<h2>Why did all these major sites start doing this?</h2>

<p>EDIT: OK <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/160376/why-move-your-javascript-files-to-a-different-main-domain-that-you-also-own#160451"">as ""onebyone"" pointed out</a>, it does appear to be related to CDN delivery of content.

"<p>Why are flat text files the state of the art for representing source code?</p>

<p>Sure - the preprocessor and compiler need to see a flat file representation of the file, but that's easily created.</p>

<p>It seems to me that some form of XML or binary data could represent lots of ideas that are very difficult to track, otherwise.</p>

<p>For instance, you could embed UML diagrams right into your code.  They could be generated semi-automatically, and annotated by the developers to highlight important aspects of the design.  Interaction diagrams in particular.  Heck, embedding any user drawing might make things more clear.</p>

<p>Another idea is to embed comments from code reviews right into the code.</p>

<p>There could be all sorts of aids to make merging multiple branches easier.</p>

<p>Something I'm passionate about is not just tracking code coverage, but also looking at the parts of code covered by an automated test.  The hard part is keeping track of that code, even as the source is modified.  For instance, moving a function from one file to another, etc.  This can be done with GUIDs, but they're rather intrusive to embed right in the text file.  In a rich file format, they could be automatic and unobtrusive.</p>

<p>So why are there no IDEs (to my knowledge, anyway) which allow you to work with code in this way?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> On October 7th, 2009.</p>

<p>Most of you got very hung up on the word ""binary"" in my question.  I retract it.  Picture XML, very minimally marking up your code.  The instant before you hand it to your normal preprocessor or compiler, you strip out all of the XML markup, and pass on just the source code.  In this form, you could still do all of the normal things to the file: diff, merge, edit, work with in a simple and minimal editor, feed them into thousands of tools.  Yes, the diff, merge, and edit, directly with the minimal XML markup, does get a tad more complicated.  But I think the value could be enormous.</p>

<p>If an IDE existed which respected all of the XML, you could add so much more than what we can do today.</p>

<p>For instance, your DOxygen comments could actually <em>look</em> like the final DOxygen output.</p>

<p>When someone wanted to do a code review, like Code Collaborator, they could mark up the source code, in place.</p>

<p>The XML could even be hidden behind comments.</p>

<pre><code>// &lt;comment author=""mcruikshank"" date=""2009-10-07""&gt;
// Please refactor to Delegate.
// &lt;/comment&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And then if you want to use vi or emacs, you can just skip over the comments.</p>

<p>If I want to use a state-of-the-art editor, I can see that in about a dozen different helpful ways.</p>

<p>So, that's my rough idea.  It's not ""building blocks"" of pictures that you drag on the screen...  I'm not that nuts.  :)</p>

"<p>I was looking for a generic method in .Net to encode a string for use in an Xml element or attribute, and was surprised when I didn't immediately find one.  So, before I go too much further, could I just be missing the built-in function?  </p>

<p>Assuming for a moment that it really doesn't exist, I'm putting together my own generic <code>EncodeForXml(string data)</code> method, and I'm thinking about the best way to do this.  </p>

<p>The data I'm using that prompted this whole thing could contain bad characters like &amp;, &lt;, &quot;, etc.  It could also contains on occasion the properly escaped entities: &amp;amp;, &amp;lt;, and &amp;quot;, which means just using a CDATA section may not be the best idea.  That seems kinda klunky anyay; I'd much rather end up with a nice string value that can be used directly in the xml.</p>

<p>I've used a regular expression in the past to just catch bad ampersands, and I'm thinking of using it to catch them in this case as well as the first step, and then doing a simple replace for other characters.  </p>

<p>So, could this be optimized further without making it too complex, and is there anything I'm missing? :</p>

<pre class=""lang-vb prettyprint-override""><code>Function EncodeForXml(ByVal data As String) As String
    Static badAmpersand As new Regex(""&amp;(?![a-zA-Z]{2,6};|#[0-9]{2,4};)"")

    data = badAmpersand.Replace(data, ""&amp;amp;"")

    return data.Replace(""&lt;"", ""&amp;lt;"").Replace("""""""", ""&amp;quot;"").Replace(""&gt;"", ""gt;"")
End Function
</code></pre>

<p><em>Sorry for all you C# -only folks-- I don't really care which language I use, but I wanted to make the Regex static and you can't do that in C# without declaring it outside the method, so this will be VB.Net</em></p>

<p>Finally, we're still on .Net 2.0 where I work, but if someone could take the final product and turn it into an extension method for the string class, that'd be pretty cool too.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> The first few responses indicate that .Net does indeed have built-in ways of doing this.  But now that I've started, I kind of want to finish my EncodeForXml() method just for the fun of it, so I'm still looking for ideas for improvement.  Notably: a more complete list of characters that should be encoded as entities (perhaps stored in a list/map), and something that gets better performance than doing a .Replace() on immutable strings in serial.</p>

"<p>Similar questions have been asked, but nothing exactly like mine, so here goes.</p>

<p>We have a collection of Microsoft Word documents on an ASP.NET web server with merge fields whose values are filled in as a result of user form submissions.

"<p>Apparently we use the Scrum development methodology. Here's generally how it goes: </p>

<p>Developers thrash around trying to accomplish their tasks. Generally the tasks take most of the sprint to complete. QA pesters Dev to release something they can test, Dev finally throws some buggy code out to QA a day or two before the sprint ends and spends the rest of the time fixing bugs that QA is finding. QA can never complete the tasks on time, sprints are rarely releasable on time, and Dev and QA have a miserable few days at the end of the sprint.</p>

<p>How is scrum supposed to work when releasable Dev tasks take up most of the sprint? </p>

"<p>Are there any downsides to passing structs by value in C, rather than passing a pointer?</p>

<p>If the struct is large, there is obviously the performancd aspect of copying lots of data, but for a smaller struct, it should basically be the same as passing several values to a function.</p>

<p>It is maybe even more interesting when used as return values. C only has single return values from functions, but you often need several. So a simple solution is to put them in a struct and return that.</p>

<p>Are there any reasons for or against this?</p>

<p>Since it might not be obvious to everyone what I'm talking about here, I'll give  a simple example.</p>

<p>If you're programming in C, you'll sooner or later start writing functions that look like this:</p>

<pre><code>void examine_data(const char *ptr, size_t len)
{
    ...
}

char *p = ...;
size_t l = ...;
examine_data(p, l);
</code></pre>

<p>This isn't a problem. The only issue is that you have to agree with your coworker in which the order the parameters should be so you use the same convention in all functions.</p>

<p>But what happens when you want to return the same kind of information? You typically get something like this:</p>

<pre><code>char *get_data(size_t *len);
{
    ...
    *len = ...datalen...;
    return ...data...;
}
size_t len;
char *p = get_data(&amp;len);
</code></pre>

<p>This works fine, but is much more problematic. A return value is a return value, except that in this implementation it isn't. There is no way to tell from the above that the function get_data isn't allowed to look at what len points to. And there is nothing that makes the compiler check that a value is actually returned through that pointer. So next month, when someone else modifies the code without understanding it properly (because he didn't read the documentation?) it gets broken without anyone noticing, or it starts crashing randomly.</p>

<p>So, the solution I propose is the simple struct</p>

<pre><code>struct blob { char *ptr; size_t len; }
</code></pre>

<p>The examples can be rewritten like this:</p>

<pre><code>void examine_data(const struct blob data)
{
    ... use data.tr and data.len ...
}

struct blob = { .ptr = ..., .len = ... };
examine_data(blob);

struct blob get_data(void);
{
    ...
    return (struct blob){ .ptr = ...data..., .len = ...len... };
}
struct blob data = get_data();
</code></pre>

<p>For some reason, I think that most people would instinctively make examine_data take a pointer to a struct blob, but I don't see why. It still gets a pointer and an integer, it's just much  clearer that they go together. And in the get_data case it is impossible to mess up in the way I described before, since there is no input value for the length, and there must be a returned length.</p>

"<p>I don't want a discussion about when to and not to throw exceptions.

The Singleton Pattern is <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11831/singletons-good-design-or-a-crutch#11839"">highly controversial</a> topic with hordes programmers on <em>both</em> sides of the fence.

<p>Single-threaded apartment... OK, that went over my head. Also, I read somewhere that unless your application uses COM interop, this attribute actually does nothing at all. So what exactly does it do, and how does it affect multithreaded applications? Should multithreaded applications (which includes anything from anyone using <code>Timer</code>s to asynchronous method calls, not just threadpools and the like) use MTAThread, even if it's 'just to be safe'? What does STAThread and MTAThread actually do?</p>

<p>Now here's the funny part.  Some of our users have recently gotten married, and their names change.

<p><strong>Follow up (for posterity):</strong></p>

<p>Grhm's answer was spot-on.  This problem pops up in low-volume servers where you don't have a lot of people using your applications, but enough requests are made to keep the users' identity in the cache.  The key part of the <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/946358"">KB</a> which seems to describe why the cache item is not refreshed after the default of 10 minutes is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The cache entries do time out, however chances are that recurring
  queries by applications keep the existing cache entry alive for the
  maximum lifetime of the cache entry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not exactly sure what in our code was causing this (the recurring queries), but the resolution which worked for us was to cut the <code>LsaLookupCacheExpireTime</code> value from the seemingly obscene default of 1 week to just a few hours.  This, for us, cut the probability that a user would be impacted in the real world to essentially zero, and yet at the same time doesn't cause an extreme number of SID-Name lookups against our directory servers.  An even better solution IMO would be if applications looked up user information by SID instead of mapping user data to textual login name.  (Take note, vendors!  If you're relying on AD authentication in your application, you'll want to put the SID in your authentication database!)</p>

"<p>I just started programming Objective-C and, having a background in Java, wonder how people writing Objective-C programs deal with private methods.</p>

<p>I understand there may be several conventions and habits and think about this question as an aggregator of the best techniques people use dealing with private methods in Objective-C. </p>

<p>Please include an argument for your approach when posting it. Why is it good? Which drawbacks does it have (that you know of) and how you deal with them?</p>

<hr/>

<p>As for my findings so far.</p>

<p>It is possible to use <a href=""http://www.otierney.net/objective-c.html#categories"">categories</a> [e.g. MyClass (Private)] defined in MyClass.m file to group private methods.</p>

<p>This approach has 2 issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>Xcode (and compiler?) does not check if you define all methods in private category in corresponding @implementation block</li>
<li>You have to put @interface declaring your private category in the begin of MyClass.m file, otherwise Xcode complains with a message like ""self may not respond to message ""privateFoo"".</li>
</ol>

<p>The first issue can be worked around with <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/Articles/chapter_4_section_5.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001163-CH20-SW2"">empty category</a> [e.g. MyClass ()].<br/>
The second one bothers me a lot. I'd like to see private methods implemented (and defined) near the end of the file; I do not know if that's possible.</p>

"<p>I'm doing some experiments with Microsoft Dynamics CRM. You interact with it through web services and I have added a Web Reference to my project. The web service interface is very rich, and the generated ""Reference.cs"" is some 90k loc. </p>

<p>I'm using the web reference in a console application. I often change something, recompile and run. Compilation is fast, but newing up the web service reference is very slow, taking some 15-20 seconds:
<code>
    CrmService service = new CrmService();
</code>
Profiling reveals that all time is spent in the SoapHttpClientProtocol constructor.</p>

<p>The culprit is apparently the fact that the XML serialization code (not included in the 90k loc mentioned above) is generated at run time, before being JIT'ed. This happens during the constructor call. The wait is rather frustrating when playing around and trying things out.</p>

<p>I've tried various combinations of sgen.exe, ngen and XGenPlus (which takes several hours and generates 500MB of additional code) but to no avail. I've considered implementing a Windows service that have few CrmService instances ready to dish out when needed but that seems excessive.</p>

"<p>I've heard the advice that you should avoid try catch blocks if possible since they're expensive.</p>

<p>My question is specifically about the .NET platform: Why are try blocks expensive?</p>

<p><strong>Summary of Responses:</strong> </p>

<p>There are clearly two camps on this issue: those that say that try blocks are expensive, and those that say ""maybe a tiny little bit"".</p>

<p>Those that say try blocks are expensive normally mention the ""high cost"" of unwinding the call stack. Personally, I'm not convinced by that argument - specially after reading about how exceptions handlers are stored <a href=""http://www.yoda.arachsys.com/csharp/exceptions2.html"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Jon Skeet sits on the ""maybe a tiny little bit"" camp, and has written two articles on exceptions and performance which you can find <a href=""http://www.yoda.arachsys.com/csharp/exceptions2.html"">here</a>.</p>

<p>There was one article that I found extremely interesting: it talked about ""other"" performance implications of try blocks (not necessarily memory or cpu consumption). Peter Ritchie mentions that he found that code inside try blocks is not optimized as it'd otherwise be by the compiler. You can read about his findings <a href=""http://msmvps.com/blogs/peterritchie/archive/2007/06/22/performance-implications-of-try-catch-finally.aspx"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, there's a blog entry about the issue from the man that implemented exceptions in the CLR. Go take a look at Chris Brumme's article <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/cbrumme/archive/2003/10/01/51524.aspx"">here</a>.</p>

  //private string mBar = ""bar"";
  public string Bar { get; set; }
  //... other methods, no constructor ...
  //behavior has changed.

<p>You could see that adding a constructor isn't inline with the effort savings I'm supposed to be getting from auto-properties.</p>

"<p>I have been working in a web project(asp.net) for around six months. The final product is about to go live. The project uses SQL Server as the database. We have done performance testing with some large volumes of data, results show that performance degrades when data becomes too large, say 2 million rows (timeout issues, delayed reponses, etc). At first we were using fully normailized database, but now we made it partially normalized due to performance issues (to reduce joins). First of all, is it the right decision?
Plus what are the possible solutions when data size becomes very large, as the no. of clients increase in future? </p>

<p>I would like to add further:</p>

<ul>
<li>2 million rows are entity tables, tables resolving the relations have much larger rows.</li>
<li>Performance degrades when data + no. of users increases. </li>
<li>Denormalization was done after identifying the heavily used queries.</li>
<li>We are also using some heavy amount of xml columns and xquery. Can this be the cause?</li>
<li>A bit off the topic, some folks in my project say that dynamic sql query is faster than a stored procedure approach. They have done some kind of performance testing to prove their point.

"<p>Being primarily a C++ developer the absence of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_acquisition_is_initialization"">RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)</a> in Java and .NET has always bothered me. The fact that the onus of cleaning up is moved from the class writer to its consumer (by means of <code>try finally</code> or .NET's <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/cyrusn/archive/2005/05/10/415956.aspx""><code>using</code> construct</a>) seems to be markedly inferior.</p>

<p>I see why in Java there is no support for RAII since all objects are located on the heap and the garbage collector inherently doesn't support deterministic destruction, but in .NET with the introduction of value-types (<code>struct</code>) we have the (seemingly) perfect candidate for RAII. A value type that's created on the stack has a well defined scope and C++ destructor semantics can be used. However the CLR does not permit a value-type to have a destructor.</p>

<p>My random searches found one argument that if a value-type is <a href=""http://www.csharphelp.com/archives/archive100.html"">boxed</a> it falls under the jurisdiction of the garbage collector and therefore its destruction becomes non-deterministic. 
I feel that this argument isn't strong enough, the benefits of RAII are big enough to say that a value-type with a destructor cannot be boxed (or used as a class member).</p>

<p><strong>To cut a long story short my question is</strong>: are there any other reasons value types can not be used in order to introduce RAII to .NET?  (or do you think my argument about RAII's obvious advantages are flawed?)</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I must have not phrased the question clearly since the first four answers have missed the point. I <em>know</em> about <code>Finalize</code> and its non-deterministic characteristics, I know about the <code>using</code> construct and I feel these two options are inferior to RAII. <code>using</code> is one more thing the consumer of a class must remember (how many people forgot to put a <code>StreamReader</code> in a <code>using</code> block?). My question is a philosophical one about the language design, why is it the way it is and can it be improved?</p>

<p>For instance with a generic deterministically destructible value-type I can make the <code>using</code> and <code>lock</code> keywords redundant (achievable by library classes):</p>

<pre><code>    public struct Disposer&lt;T&gt; where T : IDisposable
    {
        T val;
        public Disposer(T t) { val = t; }
        public T Value { get { return val; } }
        ~Disposer()  // Currently illegal 
        {
            if (val != default(T))
                val.Dispose();
        }
    }
</code></pre>

"<p>I'm familiar with the LAMP stack and over the years have successfully deployed a handful of web sties based on it. I've used everything from Apache + modPerl, to PHP, to Ruby and Rails. With good use of caching my Rails site can sustain a pretty good load, but I'm not talking massive.</p>

<p>I never really liked Java as a language, or XML for that matter, and have very much been ignoring the whole Java EE side of things.

What justifies the high price of the proprietary app servers?</p>

<p>I'm not trolling here: I'm looking for concrete examples of things that Java EE really nails that are missing from <em>modern</em> LAMP frameworks, if such differences exist.

<p>+++++ Update October 16, 2008</p>

<p>I'm sad to report that most of the replies here are not helpful, and simply fall into one of two categories: ""It scales because here are three examples of large web sites"" and ""It scales because it is really actually much better than the LAMP stack"".</p>

<p>I've done quite a bit of reading, and have concluded that Java EE only has one really good trick: transactions (thanks Will) and as for the rest you can succeed or fail on your own merit, there is nothing intrinsically in the environment to cause you to create a scalable and reliable web site, indeed Java EE has quite a few traps that make it easy to fail (for instance it is easy to start using session beans without realizing that you are paying now for quite a bit of JMS traffic that perhaps could have been avoided with a different design.)</p>

"<p>This semester, I took a course in computer graphics at my University. At the moment, we're starting to get into some of the more advanced stuff like heightmaps, averaging normals, tesselation etc.</p>

<p>I come from an object-oriented background, so I'm trying to put everything we do into reusable classes. I've had good success creating a camera class, since it depends mostly on the one call to gluLookAt(), which is pretty much independent of the rest of the OpenGL state machine.</p>

<p>However, I'm having some trouble with other aspects. Using objects to represent primitives hasn't really been a success for me.

"<p>Is there a destructor for Java? I don't seem to be able to find any documentation on this. If there isn't, how can I achieve the same effect?</p>

<p>To make my question more specific, I am writing an application that deals with data, and the specification say that there should be a 'reset' button that brings the application back to its original just launched state. However, all data have to be 'live' unless application is closed or reset button is pressed.</p>

<p>Being usually a C/C++ programmer, I thought this would be trivial to implement. (And hence I planned to implement it last.) I structured my program such that all the 'reset-able' objects would be in a same class so that I can just destroy all 'live' objects when reset button is pressed.</p>

<p>I was thinking, if all I did was just to dereference the data and wait for the garbage collector to collect them, wouldn't there be a memory leak if my user repeatedly entered data and pressed the reset button?

"<p>I'm trying to embed a window from my process into the window of an external process using the <strong>SetParent</strong> function and have encountered a few problems that I'm hoping someone can help me out with. First off, here is an outline of what I am currently doing to embed my window into the application:</p>

<pre><code>HWND myWindow; //Handle to my application window
HWND externalWindow; //Handle to external application window

SetParent(myWindow,externalWindow);

//Remove WS_POPUP style and add WS_CHILD style
DWORD style = GetWindowLong(myWindow,GWL_STYLE);
style = style &amp; ~(WS_POPUP);
style = style | WS_CHILD;
SetWindowLong(myWindow,GWL_STYLE,style);
</code></pre>

<p>This code works and my window appears in the other application, but introduces the following issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>When my window gains input focus, the main application window of the external process loses focus (i.e. title bar changes color)</li>
<li>Keyboard shortcut commands of the main application do not work while my window has focus</li>
</ul>

<p>Does anybody know a workaround for this? I would like my window to be treated as just another child window of the main application.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>First post - go easy if I've marked this up wrong or tagged it badly :P</p>

<p>In Microsoft's new ASP.NET MVC framework it seems there are two things that could cause your content to be served up at multiple URLs (something which Google penalize for and will cause your PageRank to be split across them):</p>

<ul>
<li>Case-insensitive URLs</li>
<li>Default URL</li>
</ul>

<p>You can set the default controller/action to serve up for requests to the root of your domain. Let's say we choose HomeController/Index. We end up with the following URLs serving up the same content:</p>

<ul>
<li>mydomain.com/</li>
<li>mydomain.com/Home/Index</li>
</ul>

<p>Now if people start linking to both of these then PageRank would be split. Google would also consider it duplicate content and penalize one of them to avoid duplicates in their results.</p>

<p>On top of this, the URLs are not case sensitive, so we actually get the same content for these URLs too:</p>

<ul>
<li>mydomain.com/Home/Index</li>
<li>mydomain.com/home/index</li>
<li>mydomain.com/Home/index</li>
<li>mydomain.com/home/Index</li>
<li>(the list goes on)</li>
</ul>

<p>So, the question... How do I avoid these penalties? I would like:</p>

<ul>
<li>All requests for the default action to be redirected (301 status) to the same url</li>
<li>All URLs to be case sensitive</li>
</ul>

<p>Possible?</p>

"<p>In a project I am working on, we have an ongoing discussion amongst the dev team - should the production environment be deployed as a checkout from the SVN repository or as an export?</p>

<p>The development environment is obviously a checkout, since it is constantly updated.
For the production, I'm personally for checking out the main trunk, since it makes future updates easier (just run svn update). However some of the devs are against it, as svn creates files with the group/owner and permissions of the svn process (this is on a linux OS, so those things matter), and also having the .svn directories on the production seem to them to be somewhat dirty.</p>

<p>Also, if it is a checkout - how do you push individual features to the production without including in-development code? do you use tags or branch out for each feature? any alternatives?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I might not have been clear - one of the requirement is to be able to constantly be able to push fixes to the production environment. We want to avoid a complete build (which takes much longer than a simple update) just for pushing critical fixes.</p>

"<p>Among other text and visual aids on a form submission, post-validation, I'm coloring my input boxes red to signify the interactive area needing attention.</p>

<p>On Chrome (and for Google Toolbar users) the auto-fill feature re-colors my input forms yellow. Here's the complex issue: I want auto-complete allowed on my forms, as it speeds users logging in. I am going to check into the ability to turn the autocomplete attribute to off if/when there's an error triggered, but it is a complex bit of coding to programmatically turn off the auto-complete for the single affected input on a page. This, to put it simply, would be a major headache.</p>

<p>So to try to avoid that issue, is there any simpler method of stopping Chrome from re-coloring the input boxes?</p>

"<p>I am trying to find sensible resource-allocation models for developers. The department will have many different projects for different external customers, so I need to make some guidelines in order to avoid people getting angry due to lack of focus, not working on things they want to, etc. </p>

<p>Currently I have suggestion for a model: </p>

<ul>
<li>Junior developers – will only work on one project at a time (reason: mainly that they are unable to control their own time usage)</li>
<li>Intermediate developers – will mostly work one project at a time for 50 % or more, but might be 50-50 on two projects</li>
<li>Senior developers – will work at the most on 3 projects at a time; percentage can be e.g. 50 %, 30 % and 20 %. </li>
</ul>

<p>It’s the seniors that I am worried about. As the customers might want to buy a junior-group only, I need to provide them with a mentor (senior) to make sure they have the knowledgeprogress and the aid that they need (someone with experience and knowledge about their project). A group of 5 juniors will get a senior at 50 % of the time. </p>

<p>The question is – can a senior handle 3 projects at a time (he will be hired with this in mind – I will not trick someone to believe that they will write code 100 % of the time and end up with 20 %), or is this too much? EDIT: The seniors I plan to use for mentors will not be expected to code at all. They will focus on mentoring and training themselves, e.g. in new and upcoming technologies. </p>

<p>I have a feeling that 2 projects is way better that 3? Or? What if the senior is needed 50 % on the “junior-project” and 30 % on analysis and design on another project. Can he handle one more project with the last 20 %? </p>

<p>(And no – time for training, coffee, etc. will not be part of the 100 %. I have already reduced the “real” amount of working hours with that in mind). </p>

"<p>Since multiple inheritance is bad (it makes the source more complicated) C# does not provide such a pattern directly. But sometimes it would be helpful to have this ability.</p>

<p>For instance I'm able to implement the missing multiple inheritance pattern using interfaces and three classes like that:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IFirst { void FirstMethod(); }
public interface ISecond { void SecondMethod(); }

public class First:IFirst 
{ 
    public void FirstMethod() { Console.WriteLine(""First""); } 
}

public class Second:ISecond 
{ 
    public void SecondMethod() { Console.WriteLine(""Second""); }

    Second second = new Second();
    public void FirstMethod() { first.FirstMethod(); }
    public void SecondMethod() { second.SecondMethod(); }
}

<p>So that there won't be a need to update the class FirstAndSecond when I modify one of the interfaces.</p>

<hr>

<h3>EDIT</h3>

<p>Maybe it would be better to consider a practical example:</p>

<p>You have an existing class (e.g. a text based TCP client based on ITextTcpClient) which you do already use at different locations inside your project.  Now you feel the need to create a component of your class to be easy accessible for windows forms developers.</p>

<p>As far as I know you currently have two ways to do this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Write a new class that is inherited from components and implements the interface of the TextTcpClient class using an instance of the class itself as shown with FirstAndSecond.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a new class that inherits from TextTcpClient and somehow implements IComponent (haven't actually tried this yet).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In both cases you need to do work per method and not per class. Since you know that we will need all the methods of TextTcpClient and Component it would be the easiest solution to just combine those two into one class.</p>

<p>To avoid conflicts this may be done by code generation where the result could be altered afterwards but typing this by hand is a pure pain in the ass.</p>

The only promising avenue is to pull apart Openfire which is an entire commercial (OSS) XMPP server.</p>

<p>I was just hoping for a few lines of code on top of Netty or Mina, so I could get started processing some messages off the wire.</p>

<hr>

<p>Joe - </p>

<p>Well the answer to what I am trying to do is somewhat long - I'll try to keep it short. </p>

<p>There are two things, that are only loosely related:</p>

<p>1) I wanted to write an XMPP server because I imagine writing a custom protocol for two clients to communicate.  Basically I am thinking of a networked iPhone app - but I didn't want to rely on low-level binary protocols because using something like XMPP means the app can ""grow up"" very quickly from a local wifi based app to an internet based one...</p>

<p>The msgs exchanged should be relatively low latency, so strictly speaking a binary protocol would be best, but I felt that it might be worth exploring if XMPP didn't introduce too much overhead such that I could use it and then reap benefits of it's extensability and flexability later.</p>

<p>2) I work for Terracotta - so I have this crazy bent to cluster everything.  As soon as I started thinking about writing some custom server code, I figured I wanted to cluster it.  Terracotta makes scaling out Java POJOs trivial, so my thought was to build a super simple XMPP server as a demonstration app for Terracotta.  Basically each user would connect to the server over a TCP connection, which would register the user into a hashmap.  Each user would have a LinkedBlockingQueue with a listener thread taking message from the queue.  Then any connected user that wants to send a message to any other user (e.g. any old chat application) simply issues an XMPP message (as usual) to that user over the connection.  The server picks it up, looks up the corresponding user object in a map and places the message onto the queue.  Since the queue is clustered, regardless of wether the destination user is connected to the same physical server, or a different physical server, the message is delivered and the thread that is listening picks it up and sends it back down the destination user's tcp connection.</p>

<p>So - not too short of a summary I'm afraid.  But that's what I want to do.  I suppose I could just write a plugin for Openfire to accomplish #1 but I think it takes care of a lot of plumbing so it's harder to do #2 (especially since I was hoping for a very small amount of code that could fit into a simple 10-20kb Maven project).</p>

"<p>Objective-C has no namespaces; it's much like C, everything is within one global namespace. Common practice is to prefix classes with initials, e.g. if you are working at IBM, you could prefix them with ""IBM""; if you work for Microsoft, you could use ""MS""; and so on. Sometimes the initials refer to the project, e.g. Adium prefixes classes with ""AI"" (as there is no company behind it of that you could take the initials). Apple prefixes classes with NS and says this prefix is reserved for Apple only.</p>

<p>So far so well. But appending 2 to 4 letters to a class name in front is a very, very limited namespace. E.g. MS or AI could have an entirely different meanings (AI could be Artificial Intelligence for example) and some other developer might decide to use them and create an equally named class. <em>Bang</em>, namespace collision.</p>

<p>Okay, if this is a collision between one of your own classes and one of an external framework you are using, you can easily change the naming of your class, no big deal. <strong>But what if you use two external frameworks, both frameworks that you don't have the source to and that you can't change?</strong> Your application links with both of them and you get name conflicts. How would you go about solving these? What is the best way to work around them in such a way that you can still use both classes?</p>

<p>In C you can work around these by not linking directly to the library, instead you load the library at runtime, using dlopen(), then find the symbol you are looking for using dlsym() and assign it to a global symbol (that you can name any way you like) and then access it through this global symbol. E.g. if you have a conflict because some C library has a function named open(), you could define a variable named myOpen and have it point to the open() function of the library, thus when you want to use the system open(), you just use open() and when you want to use the other one, you access it via the myOpen identifier.</p>

<p>Is something similar possible in Objective-C and if not, is there any other clever, tricky solution you can use resolve namespace conflicts? Any ideas?</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<h3>Update:</h3>

<p>Just to clarify this: answers that suggest how to avoid namespace collisions in advance or how to create a better namespace are certainly welcome; however, I will not accept them as <strong>the answer</strong> since they don't solve my problem. I have two libraries and their class names collide. I can't change them; I don't have the source of either one. The collision is already there and tips on how it could have been avoided in advance won't help anymore. I can forward them to the developers of these frameworks and hope they choose a better namespace in the future, but for the time being I'm searching a solution to work with the frameworks right now within a single application. Any solutions to make this possible?</p>

"<p>At my workplace, the traffic blocker/firewall has been getting progressively worse.  I can't connect to my home machine on port 22, and lack of ssh access makes me sad.  I was previously able to use SSH by moving it to port 5050, but I think some recent filters now treat this traffic as IM and redirect it through another proxy, maybe.  That's my best guess; in any case, my ssh connections now terminate before I get to log in.</p>

<p>These days I've been using Ajaxterm over HTTPS, as port 443 is still unmolested, but this is far from ideal.  (Sucky terminal emulation, lack of port forwarding, my browser leaks memory at an amazing rate...)  I tried setting up <code>mod_proxy_connect</code> on top of <code>mod_ssl</code>, with the idea that I could send a <code>CONNECT localhost:22 HTTP/1.1</code> request through HTTPS, and then I'd be all set.  Sadly, this seems to not work; the HTTPS connection works, up until I finish sending my request; then SSL craps out.  It appears as though <code>mod_proxy_connect</code> takes over the whole connection instead of continuing to pipe through <code>mod_ssl</code>, confusing the heck out of the HTTPS client.</p>

<p>Is there a way to get this to work?  I don't want to do this over plain HTTP, for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Leaving a big fat open proxy like that just stinks</li>
<li>A big fat open proxy is not good over HTTPS either, but with authentication required it feels fine to me</li>
<li>HTTP goes through a proxy -- I'm not <em>too</em> concerned about my traffic being sniffed, as it's ssh that'll be going ""plaintext"" through the tunnel -- but it's a lot more likely to be mangled than HTTPS, which fundamentally cannot be proxied</li>
</ul>

<p>Requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Must work over port 443, without disturbing other HTTPS traffic (i.e. I can't just put the ssh server on port 443, because I would no longer be able to serve pages over HTTPS)</li>
<li>I have or can write a simple port forwarder client that runs under Windows (or Cygwin)</li>

"<p>In the early days of C++ when it was bolted on top of C, you could not use NULL as it was defined as <code>(void*)0</code>. You could not assign NULL to any pointer other than <code>void*</code>, which made it kind of useless. Back in those days, it was accepted that you used <code>0</code> (zero) for null pointers.</p>

<p>To this day, I have continued to use zero as a null pointer but those around me insist on using <code>NULL</code>. I personally do not see any benefit to giving a name (<code>NULL</code>) to an existing value - and since I also like to test pointers as truth values:</p>

<pre><code>if (p &amp;&amp; !q)
  do_something();

<p>then using zero makes more sense (as in if you use <code>NULL</code>, you cannot logically use <code>p &amp;&amp; !q</code> - you need to explicitly compare against <code>NULL</code>, unless you assume <code>NULL</code> is zero, in which case why use <code>NULL</code>).</p>

<p>Is there any objective reason to prefer zero over NULL (or vice versa), or is all just personal preference?</p>

<p>I have an array of year, month, day, hour, minute, second and millisecond components in the form <code>[ 2008, 10, 8, 00, 16, 34, 254 ]</code>. I'd like to instantiate a Date object using the following standard constructor:</p>

<pre><code>new Date(year, month, date [, hour, minute, second, millisecond ])

<p>How can I pass my array to this constructor to get a new Date instance? <em>[ <strong>Update</strong>: My question actually extends beyond this specific example.

var d = Date.prototype.constructor.apply(this, comps);

<h2>Update: Further Experiments</h2>

<p>Since no one has been able to come up with a working answer yet, I've done more playing around. Here's a new discovery.</p>

    this.b = b;

    this.toString = function () {

}

var foo = new Foo(1, 2);
Foo.prototype.constructor.apply(foo, [4, 8]);
document.write(foo); // Returns 12 -- yay!

<p>But it doesn't work with the intrinsic Date class:</p>

<pre><code>var d = new Date();
Date.prototype.constructor.call(d, 1000);
document.write(d); // Still returns current time :(
</code></pre>

<p>Neither does it work with Number:</p>

<pre><code>var n = new Number(42);
Number.prototype.constructor.call(n, 666);
document.write(n); // Returns 42

"<p>My style of coding includes the following idiom:</p>

<pre><code>class Derived : public Base
{
   public :
      typedef Base super; // note that it could be hidden in
                          // protected/private section, instead

      // Etc.
} ;
</code></pre>

<p>This enables me to use ""super"" as an alias to Base, for example, in constructors:</p>

<pre><code>Derived(int i, int j)
   : super(i), J(j)
{
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or even when calling the method from the base class inside its overridden version:</p>

<pre><code>void Derived::foo()
{
   super::foo() ;

   // ... And then, do something else
}
</code></pre>

<p>It can even be chained (I have still to find the use for that, though):</p>

<pre><code>class DerivedDerived : public Derived
{
   public :
      typedef Derived super; // note that it could be hidden in
                             // protected/private section, instead

      // Etc.
} ;

void DerivedDerived::bar()
{
   super::bar() ; // will call Derived::bar
   super::super::bar ; // will call Base::bar

   // ... And then, do something else
}
</code></pre>

<p>Anyway, I find the use of ""typedef super"" very useful, for example, when Base is either verbose and/or templated.</p>

<p>The fact is that super is implemented in Java, as well as in C# (where it is called ""base"", unless I'm wrong). But C++ lacks this keyword.</p>

<p>So, my questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>is this use of typedef super common/rare/never seen in the code you work with?</li>
<li>is this use of typedef super Ok (i.e. do you see strong or not so strong reasons to not use it)?</li>
<li>should ""super"" be a good thing, should it be somewhat standardized in C++, or is this use through a typedef enough already?</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Edit:</b> Roddy mentionned the fact the typedef should be private. This would mean any derived class would not be able to use it without redeclaring it. But I guess it would also prevent the super::super chaining (but who's gonna cry for that?).</p>

<p><b>Edit 2:</b> Now, some months after massively using ""super"", I wholeheartedly agree with Roddy's viewpoint: ""super"" should be private. I would upvote his answer twice, but I guess I can't.</p>

"<p>One of the things that always bugs me about using Readers and Streams in Java is that the <code>close()</code> method can throw an exception. Since it's a good idea to put the close method in a finally block, that necessitates a bit of an awkward situation. I usually use this construction:</p>

<pre><code>FileReader fr = new FileReader(""SomeFile.txt"");
try {
    try {
        fr.read();
    } finally {
        fr.close();
    }
} catch(Exception e) {
    // Do exception handling
}

<p>If I close the Web.config file they go away (but they come back as soon as I need to open the file again).</p>

<p>After doing some looking, I found that this is becauase there is an XSD or schema file missing that Visual Studio needs in order to properly 'understand' the schema that is in the web.config file and provide intellisense for it. </p>

<p>Does anyone know how to either supply VS with the appropriate schema information, or to turn off these messages?</p>

<p>@Franci - Thanks for the info, I have tried that tool as well as the MMC snap in (they tend to blow up the formatting in the Web.config) but they still do not resolve the irritating warnings I receive. Thanks for trying. </p>

"<p>There is some magic going on with WCF deserialization.  How does it instantiate an instance of the data contract type without calling its constructor?</p>

<p>For example, consider this data contract:</p>

<pre><code>[DataContract]
public sealed class CreateMe
{
   [DataMember] private readonly string _name;
   [DataMember] private readonly int _age;
   private readonly bool _wasConstructorCalled;

   public CreateMe()
   {
      _wasConstructorCalled = true;
   }

   // ... other members here
}

<p>When obtaining an instance of this object via <code>DataContractSerializer</code> you will see that the field <code>_wasConstructorCalled</code> is <code>false</code>.</p>

"<p>I'm currently in the process of writing my first Windows Forms application. I've read a few C# books now so I've got a relatively good understanding of what language features C# has to deal with exceptions.

<p>Would anyone like to share any pearls of wisdom on the subject? Post any common mistakes you've seen newbies like myself make, and any general advice on handling exceptions in a way that will my application more stable and robust.</p>

<li>When should I re-throw an exception?</li>
<li>Should I try to have a central error-handling mechanism of some kind?</li>

Unfortunately, Jetty holds these files open so I can't (on Windows) modify them while it is running.</p>

"<p>I'm trying to convert an XML file into the markup used by dokuwiki, using XSLT.  This actually works to some degree, but the indentation in the XSL file is getting inserted into the results.  At the moment, I have two choices: abandon this XSLT thing entirely, and find another way to convert from XML to dokuwiki markup, or delete about 95% of the whitespace from the XSL file, making it nigh-unreadable and a maintenance nightmare.</p>

<p>Is there some way to keep the indentation in the XSL file without passing all that whitespace on to the final document?</p>

<p>Background: I'm migrating an autodoc tool from static HTML pages over to dokuwiki, so the API developed by the server team can be further documented by the applications team whenever the apps team runs into poorly-documented code.  The logic is to have a section of each page set aside for the autodoc tool, and to allow comments anywhere outside this block.  I'm using XSLT because we already have the XSL file to convert from XML to XHTML, and I'm assuming it will be faster to rewrite the XSL than to roll my own solution from scratch.</p>

<p><i>Edit: Ah, right, foolish me, I neglected the indent attribute. (Other background note: I am new to XSLT.) On the other hand, I still have to deal with newlines.  Dokuwiki uses pipes to differentiate between table columns, which means that all of the data in a table line must be on one line.  Is there a way to suppress newlines being outputted (just occasionally), so I can do some fairly complex logic for each table cell in a somewhat readable fasion?</i></p>

"<p>I'm currently in the process of choosing a project for a grad-level compiler course to be done over the next 8 weeks. I'd like to do something related to optimization since I haven't worked much in that area before, but anything in the field is fair game. </p>

<p>What was the most interesting compiler-related project you've done? What did you learn the most from?</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Thank you all for your great suggestions. I apologize for not updating this for so long.</p>

<p>The project I ended up doing was a simple autovectorization optimization on LLVM. LLVM has vector types, but there didn't seem to be any way to take advantage of them without support for the front-end. This optimization converted normal scalar code into vector code.</p>

<p>Since auto-vectorization is a fairly difficult optimization to implement, we limited our scope as much as we could. First, in order to expose instruction level parallelism in the code, we looked for one-block loops that matched our criteria, then unrolled them a specific number of times so they would be conveniently vectorizable. We then implemented the packing algorithm laid out in <a href=""http://groups.csail.mit.edu/cag/slp/SLarsen-SM.pdf"">Exploiting Superword Level Parallelism with Multimedia Instruction Sets</a> by Larsen and Amarasinghe.</p>

<p>Even a simplified version of this optimization is pretty complicated. There are a lot of constraints; for instance, you don't want to vectorize a variable that lives out of the loop, since the rest of the program expects it to be scalar. We put in a lot of hours in the last few weeks. The project was a lot of fun though, and we learned a lot. </p>

"<p>Oftentimes a developer will be faced with a choice between two possible ways to solve a problem -- one that is idiomatic and readable, and another that is less intuitive, but may perform better.  For example, in C-based languages, there are two ways to multiply a number by 2:</p>

"<p>This is kinda a general question, open for opinions. I've been trying to come up with a good way to design for localization of string resources for a Windows MFC application and related utilities. My wishlist is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Must preserve string literals in code (as opposed to replacing with macro #define resource ID's), so that the messages are still readable inline</li>
<li>Must allow localized string resources (duh)</li>
<li>Must not impose additional run-time environment restrictions (eg: dependency on .NET, etc.)</li>
<li>Should have minimal obtrusion into existing code (the less modification the better)</li>
<li>Should be debuggable</li>
<li>Should generate resource files which are editable by common tools (ie: common format)</li>
<li>Should not use copy/paste comment blocks to preserve literal strings in code, or anything else which creates the potential for de-synchronization</li>
<li>Would be nice to allow static (compile-time) checking that every ""notated"" string is in the resource file(s)</li>
<li>Would be nice to allow cross-language resource string pooling (for components in various languages, eg: native C++ and .NET)</li>
</ul>

<p>I have a way which fulfills all my wishlist to some extent except for static checking, but I have had to develop a bit of custom code to achieve it (and it has limitations). I'm wondering if anyone has solved this problem in a particularly good way.</p>

<p>Edit:
The solution I currently have looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>ShowMessage( RESTRING( _T(""Some string"") ) );
ShowMessage( RESTRING( _T(""Some string with variable %1""), sNonTranslatedStringVariable ) );
</code></pre>

<p>I then have a custom utility to parse out the strings from within the 'RESTRING' blocks and put them into a .resx file for localization, and a separate C# COM object to load them from localized resource files with fallback. If the C# object is not available (or cannot load), I fallback to the string in the code. The macro expands to a template class which calls the COM object and does the formatting, etc.</p>

<p>Anyway, I thought it would be useful to add what I have now for reference.</p>

"<p>I've incorporated Apple's Reachability sample into my own project so I know whether or not I have a network connection - if I don't have a network connection, I don't bother sending out and requests.

<p>My problem is that I start getting false negatives when on an EDGE network - the phone has connectivity, but the app thinks this isn't the case.

"<p>Ruby is becoming <a href=""http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html"">popular</a>, largely from the influence Ruby on Rails, but it feels like it is currently struggling through its adolescence. There are a lot of similarities between Ruby and Smalltalk -- <a href=""http://ruby.gemstone.com/"">maglev</a> is a testament to that. Despite having a more unusual syntax, Smalltalk has all (if not more) of the object-oriented beauty of Ruby. </p>

<p>From what I have read, Smalltalk seems to have Ruby beat on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Maturity (developed in the 1970's)</li>
<li>Stability</li>
<li>Commercial support</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.wiresong.ca/Monticello"">Distributed source control</a> (understands the structure of the code, not just text diffing)</li>
<li>Several <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk#List_of_implementations"">implementations of the VM</a></li>
<li>Cross-platform support</li>
<li>The <a href=""http://www.seaside.st/"">seaside web framework</a> as a <a href=""http://www.sauria.com/blog/2005/11/10"">strong alternative to Rails</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>It seems like Ruby is just reinventing the wheel. So, why don't Ruby developers use SmallTalk? <strong>What does Ruby have the Smalltalk doesn't?</strong> </p>

<ol>
<li><p>use a Hash table to record all words' frequency while traverse the whole word sequence. In this phase, the key is ""word"" and the value is ""word-frequency"". This takes O(n) time. </p></li>

</ol>

<p>To summarize, the total time is O(n+n<em>lg(n)+K)， Since K is surely smaller than N, so it is actually O(n</em>lg(n)).</p>

<h3>Solution with <a href=""http://www.codeplex.com/naudio"">NAudio</a></h3>

<p>With the help of <a href=""http://www.codeplex.com/naudio"">NAudio</a> 1.3 it is possible to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Load an MP3 file from a URL into a MemoryStream</li>
<li>Convert MP3 data into wave data after it was completely loaded</li>
<li>Playback the wave data using <a href=""http://www.codeplex.com/naudio"">NAudio</a>'s WaveOut class</li>
</ol>

<p>It would have been nice to be able to even play a half loaded MP3 file, but this seems to be impossible due to the <a href=""http://www.codeplex.com/naudio"">NAudio</a> library design.</p>

                    ms.Write(buffer, 0, read);

"<p>In a nutshell, the hashCode contract, according to Java's object.hashCode():</p>

"<p>I'd like to use the newer <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> tag in an ASP.NET website which, among other things, allows CSS-styled text and embedding a graphic inside the button. The asp:Button control renders as <code>&lt;input type=""button""&gt;</code>, is there any way to make a preexisting control render to <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>?</p>

<p>From what I've read there is an incompatibility with IE posting the button's markup instead of the value attribute when the button is located within a <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>, but in ASP.NET it will be using the onclick event to fire __doPostBack anyway, so I don't think that this would be a problem.</p>

<p>Are there any reasons why I shouldn't use this? If not, how would you go about supporting it with asp:Button, or a new server control based on it? I would prefer to not write my own server control if that can be avoided.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>At first the <code>&lt;button runat=""server""&gt;</code> solution worked, but I immediately ran into a situation where it needs to have a CommandName property, which the HtmlButton control doesn't have. It looks like I'm going to need to create a control inherited from Button after all. </p>

<p>What do I need to do in order to override the render method and make it render what I want?</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>DanHerbert's reply has made me interested in finding a solution to this again, so I've spent some more time working on it. </p>

<p>First, there's a far easier way of overloading the TagName:</p>

<pre><code>public ModernButton() : base(HtmlTextWriterTag.Button)
{
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with Dan's solution as it stands is the innerhtml of the tag is placed into the value property, which causes a validation error on postback. A related problem is, even if you render the value property correctly, IE's braindead implementation of the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> tag posts the innerhtml instead of the value anyway. So, any implementation of this needs to override the AddAttributesToRender method in order to correctly render the value property, and also provide some sort of workaround for IE so it doesn't completely screw up the postback.</p>

<p>The IE problem may be insurmountable if you want to take advantage of the CommandName/CommandArgument properties for a databound control. Hopefully someone can suggest a workaround for this.</p>

<p>I have made progress on the rendering:</p>

<p><a href=""http://gist.github.com/69841"">ModernButton.cs</a></p>

<p>This renders as a proper html <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> with the correct value, but it doesn't work with the ASP.Net PostBack system. I've written some of what I need to provide the <code>Command</code> event, but it doesn't fire.</p>

<p>When inspecting this button side-by-side with a regular asp:Button, they look the same other than the differences I need. So I'm not sure how ASP.Net is wiring up the <code>Command</code> event in this case.</p>

<p>An additional problem is, nested server controls aren't rendered (as you can see with the ParseChildren(false) attribute). It's pretty easy to inject literal html text into the control during render, but how do you allow support for nested server controls?</p>

<p>Where ""tuple"" is defined like so:</p>

<pre><code>public type tuple(params variables as VariableDeclaration[]) as TypeDeclaration
{
   //...
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this particular example, the type constructor <code>tuple</code> provides something similar to anonymous types in VB and C#.</p>

<p>However, unlike anonymous types, ""tuples"" have names and can be used inside public method signatures.</p>

<p>This means that I need a way for the type that eventually ends up being emitted by the compiler to be shareable across multiple assemblies. For example, I want</p>

<p><code>tuple&lt;x as int&gt;</code> defined in Assembly A to end up being the same type as <code>tuple&lt;x as int&gt;</code> defined in Assembly B.</p>

<p>The problem with this, of course, is that Assembly A and Assembly B are going to be compiled at different times, which means they would both end up emitting their own incompatible versions of the tuple type.</p>

<p>I looked into using some sort of ""type erasure"" to do this, so that I would have a shared library with a bunch of types like this (this is ""Liberty"" syntax):</p>

<pre><code>class tuple&lt;T&gt;
{
    public Field1 as T;
}

class tuple&lt;T, R&gt;
{
    public Field2 as T;
    public Field2 as R;
}
</code></pre>

<p>and then just redirect access from the i, j, and k tuple fields to <code>Field1</code>, <code>Field2</code>, and <code>Field3</code>.</p>

<p>However that is not really a viable option. This would mean that at compile time <code>tuple&lt;x as int&gt;</code> and <code>tuple&lt;y as int&gt;</code> would end up being different types, while at runtime time they would be treated as the same type. That would cause many problems for things like equality and type identity. That is too leaky of an abstraction for my tastes. </p>

<p>Other possible options would be to use ""state bag objects"". However, using a state bag would defeat the whole purpose of having support for ""type constructors"" in the language. The idea there is to enable ""custom language extensions"" to generate new types at compile time that the compiler can do static type checking with.</p>

<p>In Java, this could be done using custom class loaders. Basically the code that uses tuple types could be emitted without actually defining the type on disk. A custom ""class loader"" could then be defined that would dynamically generate the tuple type at runtime. That would allow static type checking inside the compiler, and would unify the tuple types across compilation boundaries.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, the CLR does not provide support for custom class loading. All loading in the CLR is done at the assembly level. It would be possible to define a separate assembly for each ""constructed type"", but that would very quickly lead to performance problems (having many assemblies with only one type in them would use too many resources).</p>

<p><strong>So, what I want to know is:</strong></p>

<p>Is it possible to simulate something like Java Class Loaders in .NET, where I can emit a reference to a non-existing type in and then dynamically generate a reference to that type at runtime before the code the needs to use it runs?</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>

<p>*I actually already know the answer to the question, which I provide as an answer below. However, it took me about 3 days of research, and quite a bit of IL hacking in order to come up with a solution. I figured it would be a good idea to document it here in case anyone else ran into the same problem. *</p>

"<p>I need to knock out a quick animation in C#/Windows Forms for a Halloween display.  Just some 2D shapes moving about on a solid background.  Since this is just a quick one-off project I <strong><em>really</em></strong> don't want to install and learn an entire new set of tools for this.  (DirectX dev kits, Silverlight, Flash, etc..)  I also have to install this on multiple computers so anything beyond the basic .Net framework (2.0) would be a pain in the arse.</p>

<p>For tools I've got VS2k8, 25 years of development experience, a wheelbarrow, holocaust cloak, and about 2 days to knock this out.  I haven't done animation since using assembler on my Atari 130XE (hooray for page flipping and player/missile graphics!)</p>

<p>Advice?  Here's some of the things I'd like to know:</p>

<ul>
<li>I can draw on any empty widget (like a panel) by fiddling with it's OnPaint handler, right?  That's how I'd draw a custom widget.  Is there a better technique than this?</li>
<li>Is there a page-flipping technique for this kind of thing in Windows Forms?  I'm not looking for a high frame rate, just as little flicker/drawing as necessary.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>Post Mortem Edit ... ""a couple of coding days later""</strong></p>

<p>Well, the project is done.  The links below came in handy although a couple of them were 404.  (I wish SO would allow more than one reply to be marked ""correct"").  The biggest problem I had to overcome was flickering, and a persistent bug when I tried to draw on the form directly.</p>

<ul>
<li>Using the OnPaint event for the Form: bad idea.  I never got that to work; lots of mysterious errors (stack overflows, or ArgumentNullExceptions).  I wound up using a panel sized to fill the form and that worked fine.</li>
<li>Using the OnPaint method is slow anyway.  Somewhere online I read that building the PaintEventArgs was slow, and they weren't kidding.  Lots of flickering went away when I abandoned this.  Skip the OnPaint/Invalidate() and just paint it yourself. </li>
<li><p>Setting all of the ""double buffering"" options on the form still left some flicker that had to be fixed.  (And I found conflicting docs that said ""set them on the control"" and ""set them on the form"".  Well controls don't have a .SetStyle() method.)  I haven't tested without them, so they might be doing something (<code>this</code> is the form):</p>

<pre><code>    this.SetStyle(ControlStyles.UserPaint, true);
    this.SetStyle(ControlStyles.OptimizedDoubleBuffer, true);
    this.SetStyle(ControlStyles.AllPaintingInWmPaint, true);
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>So the workhorse of the code wound up looking like (<code>pf</code> is the panel control):</p>

<pre><code>    void PaintPlayField()
    {
        Bitmap bufl = new Bitmap(pf.Width, pf.Height);
        using (Graphics g = Graphics.FromImage(bufl))
        {
            g.FillRectangle(Brushes.Black, new Rectangle(0, 0, pf.Width, pf.Height));
            DrawItems(g);
            DrawMoreItems(g);
            pf.CreateGraphics().DrawImageUnscaled(bufl, 0, 0);
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>And I just called PaintPlayField from the inside of my Timer loop.  No flicker at all.</p>

Sometimes, I need to compare user-defined types that don't have a built-in comparison operator.  In many cases, the comparison is really simple -- something like foo1.key ?= foo2.key.  Rather than creating a new IEqualityComparer for the type, can I simply specify the comparison inline using anonymous delegates/lambda functions?  Something like:</p>

<a href=""http://www.yetanotherchris.me/home/2009/3/3/friendly-unique-id-generation-part-1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Here's the resulting article</a> from this question</p>

<p>I really asked two questions here so I was cheating. The answer I was after was rcar's, however Sklivvz's is also the answer to the 2nd part (an alternative). Is it possible to make a custom unique id generator in a database, or would it be client side (which would be 2 possible reads first)?</p>

<p>The general idea I was after was using Ids in databases or other stores that can be used by phone or printed material, not a giant 16 byte guid.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong> I put the formula for two mutually exclusive events above instead of 2 independent ones (as getting an 'a' the first time doesn't mean you can't get an 'a' the second time). Should've been P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B) </p>

"<p>So far I've been using the built-in unittest module (pyUnit) for unit-testing Python code. However, for simple cases it seems like overkill. Being a derivative of xUnit, it appears a bit heavy for the dynamic nature of Python, where I would expect to write less to achieve the same effects. On the other hand, it is built-in, it makes you write your tests in an organized way, and it is tested by time.</p>

<p><em>Update 10.12.2011:</em> with the recent addition of test auto-discovery and many new features in <code>unittest</code> (in Python 2.7 and 3.2), IMHO it makes less sense to use an external library.</p>

<p>Regarding doctest:
I don't consider it a <em>unit-testing framework</em> per-se. I definitely wouldn't use it to write a large suite of tests for a sizable application. doctest is more suitable for making sure that the examples you provide in the documentation work. It has its place for this need, but it isn't a competitor for unittest, py.test and other frameworks.</p>

<li>Composition is a good substitute where interfaces are inappropriate</li>

"<p>For as long as I can remember I have avoided using switch statement fallthrough. Actually, I can't remember it ever entering my consciousness as a possible way to do things as it was drilled into my head early on that it was nothing more than a bug in the switch statement. However, today I ran across some code that uses it by design, which got me immediately wondering what everyone in the community thinks about switch statement fallthrough.</p>

<p>Is it something that a programming language should explicitly not allow (like C# does, though it supplies a workaround)  or is it a feature of any language that is powerful enough to leave in the programmer's hands?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
I wasn't specific enough to what I meant by fallthrough. I use this type a lot:</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>    switch(m_loadAnimSubCt){
        case 0: 
        case 1: 
            // Do something
            break;
        case 2:
        case 3:
        case 4:
            // Do something
            break;
   }
</code></pre>

<p>However, I'm concerned about something like this.</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>   switch(m_loadAnimSubCt){
        case 0: 
        case 1: 
            // Do something but fall through to the other cases

        case 4:
            // Do something else.
            break;
   }
</code></pre>

<p>This way whenever the case is 0, 1 it will do everything in the switch statement. I've seen this by design and I just don't know if I agree that switch statements should be used this way. I think the first code example is a very useful and safe. The second seems kind of dangerous.</p>

<p>I'm sure there's more that I haven't used or even heard of; a quick Google search reveals <a href=""http://www.purposeful.co.uk/software/gopt/"">Gopt</a>, <a href=""http://argtable.sourceforge.net/"">argtable</a>, and <a href=""http://michael.dipperstein.com/optlist/"">Optlist</a>.</p>

<p>Personally, I like <code>argp</code> best, and every program I wrote using <code>getopt</code>/<code>getopt_long</code> (beyond a certain baseline of complexity) has been converted to use <code>argp</code>.  It's more widely available than <code>popt</code>, more powerful than <code>getopt_long</code>, well-documented, consistent with all the GNU-style conventions, and very flexible.  On the downside, it's far from the easiest to use (thanks to being so flexible), and the code to support it is quite verbose (as are many things in C).</p>

<p>What do you use, and why?</p>

<h2>Edit</h2>

<p>Yes, I mean C rather than C++.  There's a ton of C++ parsers, but I don't use C++.</p>

<p>John Millikin notes that <code>popt</code> is no longer maintained.  I list it because many programs still use it -- including AbiWord, rpm, rsync, and samba -- despite Gnome's efforts to <a href=""http://live.gnome.org/ProjectRidley"">migrate away</a>.  But I've added a link to Glib's argument parser now, too.</p>

"<p>During my apprenticeship, I have used <a href=""http://nhibernate.org/"">NHibernate</a> for some smaller projects which I mostly coded and designed on my own. Now, before starting some bigger project, the discussion arose how to design data access and whether or not to use an ORM layer. As I am still in my apprenticeship and still consider myself a beginner in enterprise programming, I did not really try to push in my opinion, which is that using an object relational mapper to the database can ease development quite a lot. The other coders in the development team are much more experienced than me, so I think I will just do what they say. :-)</p>

<p>However, I do not completely understand two of the main reasons for not using NHibernate or a similar project:</p>

<ol>
<li>One can just build one’s own data access objects with SQL queries and copy those queries out of Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.</li>
<li>Debugging an ORM can be hard.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, of course I could just build my data access layer with a lot of <code>SELECT</code>s etc, but here I miss the advantage of automatic joins, lazy-loading proxy classes and a lower maintenance effort if a table gets a new column or a column gets renamed. (Updating numerous <code>SELECT</code>, <code>INSERT</code> and <code>UPDATE</code> queries vs. updating the mapping config and possibly refactoring the business classes and DTOs.)</p>

<p>Also, using NHibernate you can run into unforeseen problems if you do not know the framework very well. That could be, for example, trusting the Table.hbm.xml where you set a string’s length to be automatically validated. However, I can also imagine similar bugs in a “simple” SqlConnection query based data access layer.</p>

<p>Finally, are those arguments mentioned above really a good reason not to utilise an ORM for a non-trivial database based enterprise application? Are there probably other arguments they/I might have missed?</p>

<p>(I should probably add that I think this is like the first “big” .NET/C# based application which will require teamwork. Good practices, which are seen as pretty normal on Stack Overflow, such as unit testing or continuous integration, are non-existing here up to now.)</p>

"<p>A student of mine came to me this morning and asked for some ideas for an embedded systems (ideally hardware+software design) project to be completed in the next 6 months or so.  He's a freshman, and inexperienced, but has the motivation to learn if pointed in the right direction.  The purpose of completing this project, besides getting his feet wet in Electrical/Computer Engineering and Computer Science, is to make his resume more attractive in terms of snagging an internship in Summer '09.</p>

<p>My question is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What are some good general resources to understand simple hardware, a microcontroller, and the basics of what firmware/software is, given little to no experience in any of the above?  My own background is somewhat unhelpful here, as I learned a lot through both formal training (which he's interested in, but wants to get started now) and through the internship I got <em>my</em> freshman year through nepotism ;-) (which he wants to do, but there's a chicken-and-egg problem)</p></li>
<li><p>What are some interesting project ideas of the appropriate scope?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Some initial ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li>A Jeopardy-style game that would light up an LED, and the player who pressed his/her button first is the winner, and perhaps the microcontroller could keep score on a couple 7-segment displays.</li>
<li>A tone generator (user sets DIP switches (or more ambitiously, presses keys on a PS2 keyboard) to set a frequency), and the microcontroller uses a D/A converter to output a sinusoid of that frequency</li>
<li>Some kind of small sensor (maybe a temperature sensor for his dorm room that served up the results as an RSS feed).  The web-based aspect of this project would be made significantly easier with a RabbitCore from <a href=""http://www.rabbitsemi.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Rabbit Semiconductor</a>.</li>

"<p>Currently, I've got images (max. 6MB) stored as BLOB in a InnoDB table.
As the size of the data is growing, the nightly backup is growing slower and slower hindering normal performance.</p>

<pre><code>- main site

    - album_0
    - album_1
    - album_n
  - user_1
  - user_n

  /var/imageStorage/f/347e/013b/c042/51cf/985f7ad0daa987d.jpeg

<p>This would allow me to map the first character to a server and evenly distribute the directory structure over multiple servers.</p>

<p>This would however <em>not</em> keep images organised per user, likely spreading the images for 1 album over multiple servers.</p>

What is the best way to store the image data in the file system in a balanced way, while keeping user/album data together ?</p>

<p>Am I thinking in the right direction? or is this the wrong way of doing things altogether?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong><br>
I will go for the <code>md5(user_id)</code> string slicing for the split up on highest level.
And then put all user data in that same bucket. This will ensure an even distribution of data while keeping user data stored close together.</p>

  /var
   - imageStorage
     - f/347e/013b

           - album1_10
             - picture_1.jpeg
         - 1
           - album1_1

             - picture_3.jpeg
           - album1_11
             - picture_n.jpeg
         - n
           - album1_n

<p>I think I will use albumId splitted up from behind (I like that idea!) as to keep the number of albums per directory smaller (although it won't be necessary for most users). </p>

"<p>I have been looking at various dependency injection frameworks for .NET as I feel the project I am working on would greatly benefit from it. While I think I have a good grasp of the <em>capabilities</em> of these frameworks, I am still a little unclear on how best to introduce them into a large system. Most demos (understandably) tend to be of quite simple classes that have one or two dependencies. </p>

<p>I have three questions...</p>

<p><strong>First</strong>, how do you deal with those common but uninteresting dependencies, e.g. ILog, IApplicationSettings, IPermissions, IAudit. It seems overkill for every class to have these as parameters in their constructor. Would it be better to use a static instance of the DI container to get these when they are needed?</p>

<pre><code>MyClass(ILog log, IAudit audit, IPermissions permissions, IApplicationSettings settings)
// ... versus ...
ILog log = DIContainer.Get&lt;ILog&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Second</strong>, how do you approach dependencies that <em>might</em> be used, but may be expensive to create. Example - a class might have a dependency on an ICDBurner interface but not want the concrete implementation to be created unless the CD Burning feature was actually used. Do you pass in interfaces to factories (e.g. ICDBurnerFactory) in the constructor, or do you again go with some static way of getting directly to the DI Container and ask for it at the point it is needed?</p>

<p><strong>Third</strong>, suppose you have a large Windows Forms application, in which the top level GUI component (e.g. MainForm) is the parent of potentially hundreds of sub-panels or modal forms, each of which may have several dependencies. Does this mean that MainForm should be set up to have as dependencies the superset of all the dependencies of its children? And if you did so, wouldn't this end up creating a huge self-inflating monster that constructs every single class it could ever need the moment you create MainForm, wasting time and memory in the process?</p>

<p><strong>EDITS AND ADDITIONS</strong></p>

<p>To answer one commenter's (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/users/17826/mark-bessey"">Mark Bessey</a>'s) question: A root node is not necessary, because it is never going to be displayed anyway. ParentId = 0 is the convention to express ""these are top level"". The Order column defines how nodes with the same parent are going to be sorted.</p>

<p>The ""result set"" I spoke of can be pictured as an array of hashmaps (to stay in that terminology). For my example was meant to be already there. Some answers go the extra mile and construct it first, but thats okay.</p>

<p>The tree can be arbitrarily deep. Each node can have N children. I did not exactly have a ""millions of entries"" tree in mind, though.</p>

<p>Don't mistake my choice of node naming ('Node 1.1.1') for something to rely on. The nodes could equally well be called 'Frank' or 'Bob', no naming structure is implied, this was merely to make it readable.</p>

"<p>On an ASP.NET website, are static classes unique to each web request, or are they instantiated whenever needed and GCed whenever the GC decides to disposed of them?</p>

<p>The reason I ask is because I've written some static classes before in C# and the behavior is different than I would have expected. I would have expected static classes to be unique to each request, but it doesn't seem like that is the case.</p>

The answer driis gave me was exactly what I needed. I was already using a singleton class, however it was using a static instance and therefore was being shared between requests even if the users were different which in this case was a bad thing.

"<p>I ran into an interesting (and very frustrating) issue with the equals() method today which caused what I thought to be a well tested class to crash and cause a bug that took me a very long time to track down. </p>

<p>Just for completeness, I wasn't using an IDE or debugger - just good old fashioned text editor and System.out's. Time was very limited and it was a school project.</p>

<p>Anyhow - </p>

<p>I was developing a basic shopping cart which could contain an ArrayList of Book objects. In order to implement the addBook(), removeBook(), and hasBook() methods of the Cart, I wanted to check if the Book already existed in the cart. So off I go -</p>

<pre><code>public boolean equals(Book b) {
    ... // More code here - null checks
    if (b.getID() == this.getID()) return true;
    else return false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>All works fine in testing. I create 6 objects and fill them with data. Do many adds, removes, has() operations on the Cart and everything works fine. I read that you can either have equals(TYPE var) or equals(Object o) { (CAST) var } but assumed that since it was working, it didn't matter too much.</p>

<p>Then I ran into a problem - I needed to create a Book object with only the ID in it from within the Book class. No other data would be entered into it. Basically the following:</p>

<pre><code>public boolean hasBook(int i) {
    Book b = new Book(i);
    return hasBook(b);
}

public boolean hasBook(Book b) {
    // .. more code here
    return this.books.contains(b);
}
</code></pre>

<p>All of a sudden, the equals(Book b) method no longer works. This took a VERY long time to track down without a good debugger and assuming the Cart class was properly tested and correct. After swaapping the equals() method to the following:</p>

<pre><code>public boolean equals(Object o) {
    Book b = (Book) o;
    ... // The rest goes here   
}
</code></pre>

<p>Everything began to work again. Is there a reason the method decided not to take the Book parameter even though it clearly <b> was </b> a Book object? The only difference seemed to be it was instantiated from within the same class, and only filled with one data member. I'm very very confused. Please, shed some light?</p>

<p>My question is a little different:  <strong>Is there any way to determine the size of a C++ array programmatically?  And if not, why?</strong>  Every function I've seen that takes an array also requires an integer parameter to give it the size.

<p>This prints ""<code>Size of arr: 4</code>"", which is just the size of the pointer.  It would be nice to have some function which prints 256, but I don't think one exists in C++.  (Again, part of the question is why it doesn't exist.)</p>

"<p>I'm having performance oddities with Java2D. I know of the sun.java2d.opengl VM parameter to enable 3D acceleration for 2D, but even using that has some weird issues. </p>

<p>Drawing a 25x18 map with 32x32 pixel tiles on a JComponent<br>
Image 1 = .bmp format, Image 2 = A .png format</p>

<h2>Without -Dsun.java2d.opengl=true</h2>

13 FPS using .PNG image 2</p>

<h2>With -Dsun.java2d.opengl=true</h2>

<p>12 FPS using .BMP image 1<BR>
700 FPS using .PNG image 2</p>

<p>Without acceleration, I'm assuming some kind of transformation is taking place with every drawImage() I do in software, and is pulling down the FPS considerably in the case of .PNG. Why though, with acceleration, would the results switch (and PNG actually performs incredibly faster)?! Craziness!</p>

<p>.BMP Image 1 is translated to an image type of TYPE_INT_RGB. .PNG Image 2 is translated to an image type of TYPE_CUSTOM. In order to get consistent speed with and without opengl acceleration, I have to create a new BufferedImage with an image type of TYPE_INT_ARGB, and draw Image 1 or Image 2 to this new image. </p>

<p>Here are the results running with that:</p>

<h2>Without -Dsun.java2d.opengl=true</h2>

700 FPS using .PNG image 2</p>

"<p>Problem with dynamic controls</p>

<p>Hello all,</p>

<p>I'm wanting to create some dynamic controls, and have them persist their viewstate across page loads.  Easy enough, right?  All I have to do is re-create the controls upon each page load, using the same IDs.  HOWEVER, here's the catch - in my PreRender event, I'm wanting to clear the controls collection, and then recreate the dynamic controls with new values.  The reasons for this are complicated, and it would probably take me about a page or so to explain why I want to do it.  So, in the interests of brevity, let's just assume that I absolutely must do this, and that there's no other way.</p>

<p>The problem comes in after I re-create the controls in my PreRender event.  The re-created controls never bind to the viewstate, and their values do not persist across page loads.  I don't understand why this happens.  I'm already re-creating the controls in my OnLoad event.  When I do this, the newly created controls bind to the ViewState just fine, provided that I use the same IDs every time.  However, when I try to do the same thing in the PreRender event, it fails.</p>

<p>In any case, here is my example code : </p>

<p>namespace TestFramework.WebControls
{</p>

<pre><code>public class ValueLinkButton : LinkButton
{
    public string Value
    {
        get
        {
            return (string)ViewState[ID + ""vlbValue""];
        }

        set
        {
            ViewState[ID + ""vlbValue""] = value;
        }
    }
}

public class TestControl : WebControl
{
    protected override void OnLoad(EventArgs e)
    {
        base.OnLoad(e);

        Controls.Clear();

        ValueLinkButton tempLink = null;

        tempLink = new ValueLinkButton();
        tempLink.ID = ""valueLinkButton"";
        tempLink.Click += new EventHandler(Value_Click);

        if (!Page.IsPostBack)
        {
            tempLink.Value = ""old value"";
        }

        Controls.Add(tempLink);
    }

    protected override void OnPreRender(EventArgs e)
    {
        base.OnPreRender(e);

        ValueLinkButton tempLink = ((ValueLinkButton)FindControl(""valueLinkButton""));  //[CASE 1]

        //ValueLinkButton tempLink = new ValueLinkButton();  [CASE 2]

        tempLink.ID = ""valueLinkButton"";
        tempLink.Value = ""new value"";
        tempLink.Text = ""Click"";            

        Controls.Clear();
        Controls.Add(tempLink);
    }

    void Value_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        Page.Response.Write(""["" + ((ValueLinkButton)sender).Value + ""]"");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>So, let's examine case 1, where the line next to [CASE 1] is not commented out, but the line next to [CASE 2] is commented out.  Here, everything works just fine.  When I put this control on a page and load the page, I see a link that says ""Click"".  When I click the link, the page outputs the text ""[new value]"", and on the next line, we see the familiar ""Click"" link.  Every subesquent time I click on the ""Click"" link, we see the same thing.  So far, so good.</p>

<p>But now let's examine case 2, where the line next to [CASE 1] is commented out, but the line next to [CASE 2] is not commented out.  Here we run into problems.  When we load the page, we see the ""Click"" link.  However, when I click on the link, the page outputs the text ""[]"" instead of ""[new value]"".  The click event is firing normally.  However, the ""new value"" text that I assigned to the Value attribute of the control does not get persisted.  Once again, this is a bit of a mystery to me.  How come, when I recreate the control in OnLoad, everything's fine and dandy, but when I recreate the control in PreRender, the value doesn't get persisted?</p>

<p>I feel like there simply has to be a way to do this.  When I re-create the control in PreRender, is there some way to bind the newly created control to the ViewState?</p>

<p>I've struggled with this for days.  Any help that you can give me will be appreciated.</p>

"<p>POSIX allows mutexes to be recursive. That means the same thread can lock the same mutex twice and won't deadlock. Of course it also needs to unlock it twice, otherwise no other thread can obtain the mutex.

<p>Other APIs (more high level APIs) also usually offer mutexes, often called Locks. Some systems/languages (e.g. Cocoa Objective-C) offer both, recursive and non recursive mutexes. Some languages also only offer one or the other one. E.g. in Java mutexes are always recursive (the same thread may twice ""synchronize"" on the same object). Depending on what other thread functionality they offer, not having recursive mutexes might be no problem, as they can easily be written yourself (I already implemented recursive mutexes myself on the basis of more simple mutex/condition operations).</p>

<p>What I don't really understand: What are non-recursive mutexes good for? Why would I want to have a thread deadlock if it locks the same mutex twice? Even high level languages that could avoid that (e.g. testing if this will deadlock and throwing an exception if it does) usually don't do that. They will let the thread deadlock instead.</p>

<p>Is this only for cases, where I accidentally lock it twice and only unlock it once and in case of a recursive mutex, it would be harder to find the problem, so instead I have it deadlock immediately to see where the incorrect lock appears? But couldn't I do the same with having a lock counter returned when unlocking and in a situation, where I'm sure I released the last lock and the counter is not zero, I can throw an exception or log the problem? Or is there any other, more useful use-case of non recursive mutexes that I fail to see? Or is it maybe just performance, as a non-recursive mutex can be slightly faster than a recursive one? However, I tested this and the difference is really not that big.</p>

"<p>I have implemented what I thought was a pretty decent representation of MVC in several web applications but since having joined crackoverflow, I'm finding that perhaps my initial definitions were a bit simplistic and thus I'd really like some clarification on the differences between the Data Access Layer and the Model or Domain Layer of a web application.</p>

<p>For context, I currently use data access objects that implement the CRUD functions for a single record in the table that the object represents as well as a get() function that returns an object that allows me to iterate through all of the objects that met the criteria for the get() function. </p>

<p>These data access objects are referenced directly from the controller scripts which contain my business logic.</p>

<p>If it matters, I'm working in PHP and MySQL but am interested in suggestions that might be coded in other languages.</p>

<p><b>UPDATE:</b> For a more specific example, I have table called user (the convention here is singular table names) which holds such information as email address, active state, user name, password, which company they belong to, etc. This basic object would look like this in code:</p>

<pre><code>class User implements DataAccessObject
{
     protected $user_id;
     protected $email;
     protected $username;
     protected $password;
     protected $company_id;
     protected $active // Bool that holds either a 0 or 1

     public function __construct ( $user_id ) // Uses Primary Key to know which record to construct
     {
          $sql = //Sql to get this information from the database.

          // Code necessary to assign member variables their values from the query.
     }

     public function insert(){}
     public function update(){}
     public function delete(){}
     public static function get($filters, $orderVals, $limit){}

     // An object such as user might also contain the following function definition
     public static function login($username, $password){}

"<p>I've created a copy utility in c# (.NET 2.0 Framework) that copies files, directories and recursive sub directories etc. The program has a GUI that shows the current file being copied, the current file number (sequence), the total number of files to be copied and the percentage completed for the copy operations. There is also a progress bar, that is based on current file / total files.</p>

<p>My problem is related to copying large files. I've been unable to find a way to indicate the total copy progress of a large file (using my current class structure that utilitzes FileInfo.CopyTo method). As a workaround I've separated the file copy operations and GUI display to their own threads and set up a visual cue to show that work is being done. At least the user is aware that the program isn't frozen and is still copying files. </p>

<p>It would be nicer to be able to show the progress based on the total number of bytes or have some type of event that fires from the FileInfo.CopyTo method that indicates the total number of bytes copied from the current file.</p>

<p>I'm aware of the FileInfo.Length property, so I'm sure there is a way MacGuyver my own event that is based on this and have a handler on the GUI side of things reading the updates (maybe based on checking the FileInfo.Length property of the destination object using some type of timer?).</p>

<p>This appends a {1#}, {2#} etc. after the instance's value, effectively giving the instance a unique label. It looks like this: </p>

<h3>Meaningful values for watched variables</h3>

<p>By default, a watched variable's value is it's type. If you want to see its fields, you have to expand it, and this could take a long time (or even timeout!) if there are many fields or they do something complicated.</p>

<p>However, some predefined types show more meaningful information :</p>

<ul>
<li>strings show their actual contents</li>
<li>lists and dictionaries show their elements count etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""http://img205.imageshack.us/img205/4808/37220487md1.jpg"" alt=""meaningful info"" /></p>

<p>Wouldn't it be nice to have that for my own types? </p>

<p>Hmm... </p>

<p>...some quality time with .NET Reflector shows how easily this can be accomplished with the <code>DebuggerDisplay</code> attribute on my custom type:</p>

<pre><code>[System.Diagnostics.DebuggerDisplay(""Employee: '{Name}'"")]
public class Employee {
    public string Name { get { ... } }
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>... re-run, and...</p>

<h3>Break on all exceptions</h3>

<p>... even the ones that are handled in code!
I know, I'm such a n00b for not knowing about this ever since I was born, but here it goes anyway - maybe this will help someone someday:</p>

<p>You can force a debugged process to break into debug mode each time an exception is thrown. Ever went on a bug hunt for hours only to come across a piece of code like this?</p>

<pre><code>try {
    runStrangeContraption();
} catch(Exception ex) {
    /* TODO: Will handle this error later */
}
</code></pre>

<p>Catching all exceptions is really handy in these cases.
This can be enabled from <em>Debug > Exceptions... (Ctrl-Alt-E)</em>. Tick the boxes in the 'Thrown' column for each type of exception you need.</p>

"<p>I'm considering the best way to design a permissions system for an ""admin"" web application. The application is likely to have many users, each of whom could be assigned a certain role; some of these users could be permitted to perform specific tasks outside the role.</p>

<p>I can think of two ways to design this: one, with a ""permissions"" table with a row for every user, and boolean columns, one for each task, that assign them permissions to perform those tasks. Like this:</p>

<pre>
User ID          Manage Users     Manage Products     Manage Promotions     Manage Orders
1                true             true                true                  true

3                false            false               false                 true
</pre>

<p>Another way I thought of was to use a bit mask to store these user permissions. This would limit the number of tasks that could be managed to 31 for a 32-bit signed integer, but in practice we're unlikely to have more than 31 specific tasks that a user could perform. This way, the database schema would be simpler, and we wouldn't have to change the table structure every time we added a new task that would need access control. Like this: </p>

<pre>
User ID          Permissions (8-bit mask), would be ints in table
1                00001111
2                00000111
3                00000001

<p>I have a word list of 200.000 string entries, average string length is around 30 characters. This list of words are the key and to each key i have a domain object. I would like to find the domain objects in this collection by only knowing a part of the key. I.E. the search string ""kov"" would for example match the key ""stackoverflow"". </p>

<p>Currently I am using a Ternary Search Tree (TST), which usually will find the items within 100 milliseconds. This is however too slow for my requirements. The TST implementation could be improved with some minor optimizations and I could try to balance the tree. But i figured that these things would not give me the 5x - 10x speed improvement I am aiming at. I am assuming that the reason for being so slow is that i basically have to visit most nodes in the tree.</p>

<p>Any ideas on how to improve the speed of the algorithm? Are there any other algorithms that I should be looking at?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance,
Oskar</p>

"<p>I am writing a command-line tool for Windows that uses libcurl to download files from the internet.</p>

<p>Obviously, the downloading doesn't work when the user is behind a proxy server, because the proxy needs to be configured. I want to keep my tool as simple as possible however, and not have to burden the user with having to configure the proxy. My tool doesn't even have a config file, so the user would otherwise have to pass in the proxy settings on every command, or set an environment variable or somesuch -- way too much hassle.</p>

<p>So I thought, everyone's browser will usually already be set up properly, proxy configured and everything. This will be true for even the most basic user because otherwise ""their internet wouldn't work"".</p>

<p>So I figure that I can find out whether to use a proxy by looking at IE's proxy settings.</p>

<p>How do I go about this? More specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there one set of ""proxy settings"" in Windows, used by all browsers (probably IE's), or would I have to write different routines for IE, Firefox, Opera, etc?</li>
<li>I know that I can probably read the values directly out of the appropriate registry locations if they are configured manually, but does this also work with ""automatically detect proxy server?"" Do I even have to bother with that option, or is it (almost) never used?</li>
</ul>

<p>Before people start suggesting alternatives: I'm using C, so I'm limited to the Win32 API, and I really really want to keep using C and libcurl.</p>

"<p>I currently work for a bespoke software agency. Does anyone have any experience of how to win well priced work?</p>

<p>It seems there is so much competition from offshore/bedroom programming teams, that cost is extremely competetive these days. I feel that it is very different compared to a software product company or an internal IT department in terms of budget.</p>

<p>As someone else said before, we only ever really get to version 1.0 of a lot of our software, unless the client is big enough. In this case it doesn't make business sense to spend ages making the software the best we can. It's like we are doing the same quality of work as internal IT staff. Also a lot of our clients are not technically minded and so therefore will not pay for things they don't understand.</p>

<p>As our company does not have the money to turn down work it often goes that we take on complicated work for far too little money. I have gotten a lot better at managing change and keeping tight specs, etc. It is still hard.</p>

"<p>For years, I've been using named blocks to limit the scope of temporary variables.  I've never seen this done anywhere else, which makes me wonder if this is a bad idea.  Especially since the Eclipse IDE flags these as warnings by default.</p>

<p>I've used this to good effect, I think, in my own code.  But since it is un-idiomatic to the point where good programmers will distrust it when they see it, I really have two ways to go from here:  </p>

<ol>
<li>avoid doing it, or </li>
<li>promote it, with the hope that it will become an idiom.</li>
</ol>

<p>Example (within a larger method):</p>

<pre><code>final Date nextTuesday;
initNextTuesday: {
    GregorianCalendar cal = new GregorianCalendar();
    ... // About 5-10 lines of setting the calendar fields
    nextTuesday = cal.getTime();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here I'm using a GregorianCalendar just to initialize a date, and I want to make sure that I don't accidentally reuse it.</p>

<p>Some people have commented that you don't actually need to name the block.  While that's true, a raw block looks even more like a bug, as the intent is unclear.  Furthermore, naming something encourages you to think about the intention of the block.  The goal here is to identify distinct sections of code, not to give every temporary variable its own scope.</p>

<p>Many people have commented that it's best to go straight to small methods.  I agree that this should be your first instinct.  However, there may be several mitigating factors:</p>

<ul>
<li>To even consider a named block, the code should be short, one-off code that will never be called elsewhere.</li>
<li>A named block is a quick way to organize an oversized method without creating a one-off method with a dozen parameters.  This is especially true when a class is in flux, and the inputs are likely to change from version to version.</li>
<li>Creating a new method encourages its reuse, which may be ill-advised if the use cases aren't well-established.  A named block is easier (psychologically, at least) to throw away.</li>
<li>Especially for unit tests, you may need to define a dozen different objects for one-off assertions, and they are just different enough that you can't (yet) find a way to consolidate them into a small number of methods, nor can you think of a way to distinguish them with names that aren't a mile long.</li>
</ul>

<p>Advantages of using the named scope:</p>

<ol>
<li>Can't accidentally reuse temporary variables</li>
<li>Limited scope gives garbage collector and JIT compiler more information about programmer intent</li>
<li>Block name provides a comment on a block of code, which I find more readable than open-ended comments</li>
<li>Makes it easier to refactor code out of a big method into little methods, or vice versa, since the named block is easier to separate than unstructured code.</li>
</ol>

<p>Disadvantages:</p>

<p>Not idiomatic: programmers who haven't seen this use of named blocks (i.e. everyone but me) assume it's buggy, since they can't find references to the block name.  (Just like Eclipse does.)  And getting something to become idiomatic is an uphill battle.</p>

<p>It can be used as an excuse for bad programming habits, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Making huge, monolithic methods where several small methods would be more legible.</li>
<li>Layers of indentation too deep to read easily.</li>
</ul>

"<p>I have a form with multiple fields that I'm validating (some with methods added for custom validation) with Jörn Zaeffere's excellent jQuery Validation plugin. How do you circumvent validation with specified submit controls (in other words, fire validation with some submit inputs, but do not fire validation with others)? This would be similar to ValidationGroups with standard ASP.NET validator controls.</p>

<p>My situation:</p>

<p>It's with ASP.NET WebForms, but you can ignore that if you wish. However, I am using the validation more as a ""recommendation"": in other words, when the form is submitted, validation fires but instead of a ""required"" message displaying, a ""recommendation"" shows that says something along the line of ""you missed the following fields.... do you wish to proceed anyways?"" At that point in the error container there's another submit button now visible that can be pressed which would ignore the validation and submit anyways. How to circumvent the forms .validate() for this button control and still post?</p>

<p>The Buy and Sell a House sample at <a href=""http://jquery.bassistance.de/validate/demo/multipart/"">http://jquery.bassistance.de/validate/demo/multipart/</a> allows for this in order to hit the previous links, but it does so through creating custom methods and adding it to the validator. I would prefer to not have to create custom methods duplicating functionality already in the validation plugin.</p>

<p>The following is a shortened version of the immediately applicable script that I've got right now:</p>

<pre><code>var container = $(""#&lt;%= Form.ClientID %&gt; div.validationSuggestion"");

$('#&lt;%= Form.ClientID %&gt;').validate({          
    errorContainer: container,
    errorLabelContainer: $(""ul"",container),
    rules: {
        &lt;%= YesNo.UniqueID %&gt;: { required: true },
        &lt;%= ShortText.UniqueID %&gt;: { required: true } // etc.

    },
    messages: {
        &lt;%= YesNo.UniqueID %&gt;: 'A message.',
        &lt;%= ShortText.UniqueID %&gt;: 'Another message.' // etc.
    },

<p>So, I want to look at all of the classes in my application's universe, and when I find one that descends from Animal, I want to create a new object of that type and add it to the list.

<pre><code>List&lt;Animal&gt; animals = new ArrayList&lt;Animal&gt;();
animals.add( new Dog() );
animals.add( new Cat() );
animals.add( new Donkey() );

<p>With the above approach, I can simply create a new class that extends Animal and it'll get picked up automatically.</p>

<p>This question has generated a lot of great responses -- thank you.  From the responses and my research, I've found that what I really want to do is just not possible under Java.  There are approaches, such as ddimitrov's ServiceLoader mechanism that can work -- but they are very heavy for what I want, and I believe I simply move the problem from Java code to an external configuration file.  </p>

<p>Another way to state what I want: a static function in my Animal class finds and instantiates all classes that inherit from Animal -- without any further configuration/coding.  If I have to configure, I might as well just instantiate them in the Animal class anyway.  I understand that because a Java program is just a loose federation of .class files that that's just the way it is.</p>

<p>If I try to use values of certain types as boolean expressions, I get a warning.  Rather than suppress the warning, I sometimes use the ternary operator (<code>?:</code>) to convert to a bool.  Using two not operators (<code>!!</code>) seems to do the same thing.</p>

<p>Here's what I mean:</p>

<pre><code>typedef long T;       // similar warning with void * or double
T t = 0;
bool b = t;           // performance warning: forcing 'long' value to 'bool'
b = t ? true : false; // ok
b = !!t;              // any different?

<p>So, does the double-not technique really do the same thing?  Is it any more or less safe than the ternary technique?  Is this technique equally safe with non-integral types (e.g., with <code>void *</code> or <code>double</code> for <code>T</code>)?</p>

<p>They're all hidden under the Libraries category in the ""Pick an API"" box. I overlooked the category because I thought it was for an app called Google Libraries. There's also a Javascript category for Javascript itself.</p>

"<p>I'm looking for a reasonable way to represent searches as a RESTful URLs.</p>

<p>The setup: I have two models, Cars and Garages, where Cars can be in Garages. So my urls look like:</p>

<pre><code>/car/xxxx
  xxx == car id
  returns car with given id

/garage/yyy
  yyy = garage id
  returns garage with given id
</code></pre>

<p>A Car can exist on its own (hence the /car), or it can exist in a garage. What's the right way to represent, say, all the cars in a given garage? Something like:</p>

<pre><code>/garage/yyy/cars     ?
</code></pre>

<p>How about the union of cars in garage yyy and zzz?</p>

<p>What's the right way to represent a search for cars with certain attributes? Say: show me all blue sedans with 4 doors :</p>

<pre><code>/car/search?color=blue&amp;type=sedan&amp;doors=4
</code></pre>

<p>or should it be /cars instead?</p>

<p>The use of ""search"" seems inappropriate there - what's a better way / term? Should it just be:</p>

<pre><code>/cars/?color=blue&amp;type=sedan&amp;doors=4

"<p>HTML (or maybe just XHTML?) is relatively strict when it comes to non-standard attributes on tags. If they aren't part of the spec, then your code is considered non-compliant.</p>

<p>Non-standard attributes can be fairly useful for passing along meta-data to Javascript however. For instance, if a link is suppose to show a popup, you can set the name of the popup in an attribute:</p>

   popup_title=""Title for My Popup""&gt;click me&lt;/a&gt;

"<p>Is it possible to search every field of every table for a particular value in Oracle?</p>

<p>There are hundreds of tables with thousands of rows in some tables so I know this could take a very long time to query. But the only thing I know is that a value for the field I would like to query against is <code>1/22/2008P09RR8</code>.

"<p>I have a business requirement that forces me to store a customer's full credit card details (number, name, expiry date, CVV2) for a short period of time.</p>

<p>Rationale: If a customer calls to order a product and their credit card is declined on the spot you are likely to lose the sale. If you take their details, thank them for the transaction and then find that the card is declined, you can phone them back and they are more likely to find another way of paying for the product. If the credit card is accepted you clear the details from the order.</p>

"<p>At work we have two competing theories for salts.  The products I work on use something like a user name or phone number to salt the hash.  Essentially something that is different for each user but is readily available to us.  The other product randomly generates a salt for each user and changes each time the user changes the password.  The salt is then encrypted in the database.</p>

<p>My question is if the second approach is really necessary?  I can understand from a purely theoretical perspective that it is more secure than the first approach, but what about from a practicality point of view.  Right now to authenticate a user, the salt must be unencrypted and applied to the login information.  </p>

<p>After thinking about it, I just don't see a real security gain from this approach.  Changing the salt from account to account, still makes it extremely difficult for someone to attempt to brute force the hashing algorithm even if the attacker was aware of how to quickly determine what it was for each account.  This is going on the assumption that the  passwords are sufficiently strong.  (Obviously finding the correct hash for a set of passwords where they are all two digits is significantly easier than finding the correct hash of passwords which are 8 digits).  Am I incorrect in my logic, or is there something that I am missing?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Okay so here's the reason why I think it's really moot to encrypt the salt.  (lemme know if I'm on the right track).  </p>

<p>For the following explanation, we'll assume that the passwords are always 8 characters and the salt is 5 and all passwords are comprised of lowercase letters (it just makes the math easier).</p>

<p>Having a different salt for each entry means that I can't use the same rainbow table (actually technically I could if I had one of sufficient size, but let's ignore that for the moment).  This is the real key to the salt from what I understand, because to crack every account I have to reinvent the wheel so to speak for each one.  Now if I know how to apply the correct salt to a password to generate the hash, I'd do it because a salt really just extends the length/complexity of the hashed phrase.  So I would be cutting the number of possible combinations I would need to generate to ""know"" I have the password + salt from 13^26 to 8^26 because I know what the salt is.  Now that makes it easier, but still really hard.  </p>

<p>So onto encrypting the salt.  If I know the salt is encrypted, I wouldn't try and decrypt (assuming I know it has a sufficient level of encryption) it first.  I would ignore it.  Instead of trying to figure out how to decrypt it, going back to the previous example I would just generate a larger rainbow table containing all keys for the 13^26.  Not knowing the salt would definitely slow me down, but I don't think it would add the monumental task of trying to crack the salt encryption first.  That's why I don't think it's worth it.  Thoughts?</p>

"<p>The <a href=""http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/inheritance/"">C++ friend keyword</a> allows a <code>class A</code> to designate <code>class B</code> as its friend.

<p>I've never read anything as to why this was left out of C# (and VB.NET). Most answers to this <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17434/when-should-you-use-friend-in-c"">earlier StackOverflow question</a> seem to be saying it is a useful part of C++ and there are good reasons to use it.  In my experience I'd have to agree.</p>

<p>Another <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/200079/inheritance-trees-and-protected-constructors-in-c#200117"">question</a> seems to me to be really asking how to do something similar to <code>friend</code> in a C# application.

"<p>This is a problem I've had on my mind for a long time. Being the son of a teacher and a programmer, it occurred to me early on... but I still haven't found a solution for it.</p>

<p>So this is the problem. One needs to create a time schedule for a school, using some constraints. These are generally divided in two categories:</p>

<p><strong>Sanity Checks</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>A teacher cannot teach two classes at the same time</li>
<li>A student cannot follow two lessons at the same time</li>
<li>Some teachers must have at least one day off during the week</li>
<li>All the days of the week should be covered by the time table</li>
<li>Subject X must have exactly so-and-so hours each week</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Preferences</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>Each teacher's schedule should be as compact as possible (i.e. the teacher should work all hours for the day in a row with no pauses if possible)</li>
<li>Teachers that have days off should be able to express a preference on which day</li>
<li>Teachers that work part-time should be able to express a preference whether to work in the beginning or the end of the school day.</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, after a few years of not finding a solution (and learning a thing or two in the meanwhile...), I realized that this smells like a NP-hard problem.</p>

<p>Is it proven as NP-hard? </p>

<p>Does anyone have an idea on how to crack this thing?</p>

<p>Looking at <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/184195/seating-plan-software-recommendations-does-such-a-beast-even-exist"">this</a> question made me think about this problem, and whether genetic algorithms would be usable in this case. However it would be pretty hard to mutate possibilities while maintaining the sanity check rules. Also it's not clear to me how to distinguish incompatible requirements.</p>

<hr>

<p>A small addendum to better specify the problem. This is applied to Italian school style classrooms where all students are associated in different classes (for example: year 1 section A) and the teachers move between classes. All students of the same class have the same schedule, and have no choice over which lessons to attend.</p>

While that has been fun (and not so fun), I'm at a point where I'd like to abandon the daily commute and corporate life, and instead try to make a living working from home.

<p>I thought of using <code>bisect_left</code> and then checking if the item at that position is equal to what I'm searching, but that seems cumbersome (and I also need to do bounds checking if the number can be larger than the largest number in my list).

"<p>I'm using jQuery to hide and show elements when a radio button group is altered/clicked. It works fine in browsers like Firefox, but in IE 6 and 7, the action only occurs when the user then clicks somewhere else on the page.</p>

<p>To elaborate, when you load the page, everything looks fine. In Firefox, if you click a radio button, one table row is hidden and the other one is shown immediately. However, in IE 6 and 7, you click the radio button and nothing will happen until you click somewhere on the page. Only then does IE redraw the page, hiding and showing the relevant elements.</p>

"<p>When I worked on the <a href=""http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.html"">Zend Framework's database component</a>, we tried to abstract the functionality of the <code>LIMIT</code> clause supported by MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.  That is, creating a query could be done this way:</p>

<pre><code>$select = $db-&gt;select();
$select-&gt;from('mytable');
$select-&gt;order('somecolumn');
$select-&gt;limit(10, 20);
</code></pre>

<p>When the database supports <code>LIMIT</code>, this produces an SQL query like the following:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM mytable ORDER BY somecolumn LIMIT 10, 20
</code></pre>

<p>This was more complex for brands of database that don't support <code>LIMIT</code> (that clause is not part of the standard SQL language, by the way).  If you can generate row numbers, make the whole query a derived table, and in the outer query use <code>BETWEEN</code>.  This was the solution for Oracle and IBM DB2.  Microsoft SQL Server 2005 has a similar row-number function, so one can write the query this way:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT z2.*
FROM (
    SELECT ROW_NUMBER OVER(ORDER BY id) AS zend_db_rownum, z1.*
    FROM ( ...original SQL query... ) z1
) z2
WHERE z2.zend_db_rownum BETWEEN @offset+1 AND @offset+@count;
</code></pre>

<p>However, Microsoft SQL Server 2000 doesn't have the <code>ROW_NUMBER()</code> function.</p>

<p>So my question is, can you come up with a way to emulate the <code>LIMIT</code> functionality in Microsoft SQL Server 2000, solely using SQL?  Without using cursors or T-SQL or a stored procedure.  It has to support both arguments for <code>LIMIT</code>, both count and offset.  Solutions using a temporary table are also not acceptable.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>The most common solution for MS SQL Server 2000 seems to be like the one below, for example to get rows 50 through 75:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT TOP 25 *
FROM ( 
  SELECT TOP 75 *
  FROM   table 
  ORDER BY BY field ASC
) a 
ORDER BY field DESC;
</code></pre>

<p>However, this doesn't work if the total result set is, say 60 rows.  The inner query returns 60 rows because that's in the top 75.  Then the outer query returns rows 35-60, which doesn't fit in the desired ""page"" of 50-75.  Basically, this solution works unless you need the last ""page"" of a result set that doesn't happen to be a multiple of the page size.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>Another solution works better, but only if you can assume the result set includes a column that is unique:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT TOP n *
FROM tablename
WHERE key NOT IN (
    SELECT TOP x key
    FROM tablename
    ORDER BY key
);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

<p>No general-purpose solution seems to exist for emulating <code>LIMIT</code> in MS SQL Server 2000.  A good solution exists if you can use the <code>ROW_NUMBER()</code> function in MS SQL Server 2005.</p>

    bool operator != (const TypesafeEnum&amp; right) const;
    bool operator &lt; (const TypesafeEnum&amp; right) const;

    std::string to_string() const { return name; }

// Implementation:
private:
    static int next_id;
    int id;
    std::string name;
};
</code></pre>

<p>typesafeenum.cpp:</p>

<pre><code>int TypesafeEnum::next_id = 1;

bool TypesafeEnum::operator== (const TypesafeEnum&amp; right) const 
{ return id == right.id; }

bool TypesafeEnum::operator!= (const TypesafeEnum&amp; right) const

<p>This is the result I'm trying to obtain using jQuery.</p>

<pre><code>Column1  Column2
Column1  Column2
...Show Full Table...
Column1  Column2
Column1  Column2
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to use jQuery's show/hide feature to minimize the table but still show part of the top and bottom rows. The middle rows should be replace with text like ""Show Full Table"" and when clicked will expand to show the full table from start to finish.</p>

<p>What is the best way to do this in jQuery?</p>

<p>BTW I've already tried adding a class ""Table_Middle"" to some of the rows but it doesn't hide it completely the space it occupied is still there and I don't have the text to give the user a way to expand the table fully.</p>

<hr>

<p>This seems a bit bizarre to me, but as far as I can tell, this is how you do it.</p>

<p>I have a collection of objects, and I want users to select one or more of them.  This says to me ""form with checkboxes.""  My objects don't have any concept of ""selected"" (they're rudimentary POCO's formed by deserializing a wcf call).  So, I do the following:</p>

<pre><code>public class SampleObject{
  public Guid Id {get;set;}
  public string Name {get;set;}
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the view:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%
    using (Html.BeginForm())
    {
%&gt;
  &lt;%foreach (var o in ViewData.Model) {%&gt;
    &lt;%=Html.CheckBox(o.Id)%&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;%= o.Name %&gt;
  &lt;%}%&gt;
  &lt;input type=""submit"" value=""Submit"" /&gt;
&lt;%}%&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And, in the controller, this is the only way I can see to figure out what objects the user checked:</p>

<pre><code>public ActionResult ThisLooksWeird(FormCollection result)
{
  var winnars = from x in result.AllKeys
          where result[x] != ""false""
          select x;
  // yadda
}
</code></pre>

<p>Its freaky in the first place, and secondly, for those items the user checked, the FormCollection lists its value as ""true false"" rather than just true.  </p>

<p>Obviously, I'm missing something.  I think this is built with the idea in mind that the objects in the collection that are acted upon within the html form are updated using <code>UpdateModel()</code> or through a ModelBinder.  </p>

<p>But my objects aren't set up for this; does that mean that this is the only way?  Is there another way to do it?</p>

"<p>I've been thinking a lot lately about how to go about doing functional programming in C (<em>not</em> C++).  Obviously, C is a procedural language and doesn't really support functional programming natively.</p>

<p>Are there any compiler/language extensions that add some functional programming constructs to the language?  GCC provides <a href=""http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Nested-Functions.html"">nested functions</a> as a language extension; nested functions can access variables from the parent stack frame, but this is still a long way away from mature closures.</p>

<p>For example, one thing that I think could be really useful in C is that anywhere where a function pointer is expected, you could be able to pass a lambda expression, creating a closure which decays into a function pointer.  C++0x is going to include lambda expressions (which I think is awesome); however, I'm looking for tools applicable to straight C.</p>

"<p>I want to ask a question about how you would approach a simple object-oriented design problem. I have a few ideas of my own about what the best way of tackling this scenario, but I would be interested in hearing some opinions from the Stack Overflow community. Links to relevant online articles are also appreciated. I'm using C#, but the question is not language specific.</p>

<p>Suppose I am writing a video store application whose database has a <code>Person</code> table, with <code>PersonId</code>, <code>Name</code>, <code>DateOfBirth</code> and <code>Address</code> fields. It also has a <code>Staff</code> table, which has a link to a <code>PersonId</code>, and a <code>Customer</code> table which also links to <code>PersonId</code>.</p>

<p>A simple object oriented approach would be to say that a <code>Customer</code> ""is a"" <code>Person</code> and therefore create classes a bit like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Person {
    public int PersonId { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public DateTime DateOfBirth { get; set; }
    public string Address { get; set; }
}

class Customer : Person {
    public int CustomerId { get; set; }
    public DateTime JoinedDate { get; set; }
}

class Staff : Person {
    public int StaffId { get; set; }
    public string JobTitle { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can write a function say to send emails to all customers:</p>

<pre><code>static void SendEmailToCustomers(IEnumerable&lt;Person&gt; everyone) { 
    foreach(Person p in everyone)
        if(p is Customer)
            SendEmail(p);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This system works fine until we have someone who is both a customer and a member of staff. Assuming that we don't really want our <code>everyone</code> list to have the same person in twice, once as a <code>Customer</code> and once as a <code>Staff</code>, do we make an arbitrary choice between:</p>

<pre><code>class StaffCustomer : Customer { ...
</code></pre>

<p>and </p>

<pre><code>class StaffCustomer : Staff { ...
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously only the first of these two would not break the <code>SendEmailToCustomers</code> function.</p>

<p>So what would you do? </p>

<ul>
<li>Make the <code>Person</code> class have optional references to a <code>StaffDetails</code> and <code>CustomerDetails</code> class? </li>
<li>Create a new class that contained a <code>Person</code>, plus optional <code>StaffDetails</code> and <code>CustomerDetails</code>? </li>
<li>Make everything an interface (e.g. <code>IPerson</code>, <code>IStaff</code>, <code>ICustomer</code>) and create three classes that implemented the appropriate interfaces? </li>
<li>Take another completely different approach?</li>

<li>Not a full-blown video editor. No need for fancy pants stuff. Just the ability to skip to different parts of a video and either grab a frame or put (multiple) markers for start and end of video sections to lop off bits.</li>

"<p>Although elements like <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s normally grow to fit their contents, using the <code>float</code> property can cause a startling problem for CSS newbies: <strong>if floated elements have non-floated parent elements, the parent will collapse.</strong></p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The parent div in this example will <strong>not expand</strong> to contain its floated children - it will appear to have <code>height: 0</code>.</p>

<h1>How do you solve this problem?</h1>

<p><em>I would like to create an exhaustive list of solutions here. If you're aware of cross-browser compatibility issues, please point them out.</em>  </p>

<h2>Solution 1</h2>

<p>Float the parent.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;
    &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Semantic code.<br />
<strong>Cons</strong>: You may not always want the parent floated. Even if you do, do you float the parents' parent, and so on? Must you float every ancestor element?</p>

<h2>Solution 2</h2>

<p>Give the parent an explicit height.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div style=""height: 300px;""&gt;
    &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;        
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Semantic code.<br />
<strong>Cons</strong>: Not flexible - if the content changes or the browser is resized, the layout will break.</p>

<h2>Solution 3</h2>

<p>Append a ""spacer"" element inside the parent element, like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=""spacer"" style=""clear: both;""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Straightforward to code.<br />
<strong>Cons</strong>: Not semantic; the spacer div exists only as a layout hack.</p>

<h2>Solution 4</h2>

<p>Set parent to <code>overflow: auto</code>.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div style=""overflow: auto;""&gt;
    &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;        
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Doesn't require extra div.<br />
<strong>Cons</strong>: Seems like a hack - that's not the <code>overflow</code> property's stated purpose.</p>

"<p>As mentioned in many of my previous questions, I'm working through K&amp;R, and am currently into the preprocessor. One of the more interesting things &mdash; something I never knew before from any of my prior attempts to learn C &mdash; is the <code>##</code> preprocessor operator. According to K&amp;R:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The preprocessor operator <code>##</code>
  provides a way to concatenate actual
  arguments during macro expansion. If a
  parameter in the replacement text is
  adjacent to a <code>##</code>, the parameter is
  replaced by the actual argument, the
  <code>##</code> and surrounding white space are
  removed, and the result is re-scanned.
  For example, the macro <code>paste</code>
  concatenates its two arguments:</p>
  
  <p><code>#define  paste(front, back)  front ## back</code></p>
  
  <p>so <code>paste(name, 1)</code> creates the token
  <code>name1</code>.</p>

"<p>I am starting to develop an Eclipse plugin (technically, an OSGi plugin) and one of the first problems I've run into is that I can't seem to control the commons-logging output as I normally would.</p>

<p>I've included the commons-logging package in the plugin dependencies, and indeed, when I log something (at INFO or higher severity) it is logged to the console.  However, I can't seem to log at any lower level (such as DEBUG or TRACE).</p>

<p>I have specified a log4j.properties file, and it is on the classpath (for the runtime, just as the commons-logging package is) but none of the settings in that properties file have any impact on the behavior of the logger.</p>

<p>Here's the log4j.properties file:</p>

<pre><code>#  Log4j Logging levels, in order of decreasing importance are:
#   FATAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE
#

# Root logger option
log4j.rootLogger=ERROR,stdout
#,LOGFILE

# Direct log messages to stdout
log4j.appender.stdout=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender
log4j.appender.stdout.Target=System.out

log4j.appender.stdout.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{ABSOLUTE} %5p %r (%l) %t%n - %m%n

<p>and I can <em>only</em> get DEBUG, or lower, level messages to appear if I am running OSGi manually from a prompt (which is impractical for what I am developing).  Furthermore, I can't effect any other type of logging configuration via various properties files.  Everything I try in that regard seems to be overridden by an eclipse setting.</p>

<li>Convert lat/lon points to screen coordinates?  - As far as I know the Shapefile uses longitude and latitude for its points.  So obviously I'm going to have to convert these somehow to screen coordinates to display the map features.</li>
<li>Render the map data (A series of polylines for roads, boundaries, etc) in a way that I can easily rotate and scale the entire map?</li>
<li>Render my whole map as a series of ""tiles"" so only the features/lines within the viewing area are rendered?</li>

I didn't write any of these - in fact, most of the original authors have long since left the company - but from time to time another Access app lands on my desk for support.  I would <em>soooo</em> love to replace access with a different solution.  </p>

<h3>Requirement</h3>

<p>I know that there are several good alternatives for the database part of MS Access (the Jet database), such as SQLite, MySQL, VistaDB, etc.  </p>

<p>What I would like to know is:  Is there anything that will replace the front end part of MS Access?  </p>

<p>I.e.  Something which can be used to build forms, write simple scripts and queries, etc?  </p>

<h3>Why?</h3>

<p>@BracC asked ""why replace access?""  - A fair question indeed.<br />
I want to get rid of access because:  </p>

<ul>
<li>it hides logic, leading to hard-to-support applications.  Logic can be in lots of different places, none of which provide or encourage any structure: 
<ul>
<li>macros</li>
<li>modules</li>
<li>queries</li>
<li>forms</li>
</ul></li>
<li>its very nature encourages users to create ""little"" applications which become ""not so little applications"".  Then the user leaves and I have to support a bunch of spaghetti.  I know that access isn't the only culprit, but it's the leader in my organisation, and I would love to get rid of it completely.  </li>
</ul>

<h3>For extra credit</h3>

<p>what I would <em>really</em> love to find is something which can read in an MDB file and output something like C# which replicates the functionality.  (Or any language - not fussy).  </p>

<p>I hope this is all clear.  If not, please post a comment and I'll re-write/add detail.  </p>

<h3>Update</h3>

<p>@GuinnessFan makes some points I find interesting.  I have added my comments to discuss those points.   </p>

<p>What we have done since I asked the question: </p>

<ul>
<li>Got users to give us a definitive list of access applications they use and need.  (The understanding is that any MDB files not on the list can be deleted - hooray!).  </li>
<li>Analysed the MDBs on the list, coming to the following conclusions: 
<ul>
<li>Most of the ""applications"" consist of a single hard-coded query or a single linked table.  </li>
<li>Many are a small number of queries with, perhaps, a date parameter or similar.  </li>
<li>very few (if any) have any truly complex logic.  </li>
</ul></li>
<li>We are now working through the list, converting most of the apps to SSRS (SQL Server Reporting Services) packages.  </li>
<li>Anything which can't be replicated using SSRS will become a hand-crafted web application.  However, there aren't many of these.  </li>
</ul>

<p>May I say many thanks, to _**everybody**_ who has given me helpful answers.  </p>

"<p>I'm not exactly sure how to word this question.</p>

<p>I learnt what currying was in the first year of university, and have been using it where applicable ever since.</p>

<p>However, I quite often see on the Internet various complaints that other peoples examples of currying are not currying, but are actually just partial application.</p>

<p>I've not found a decent explanation of what partial application is, or how it differs from currying. There seems to be a general confusion, with equivalent examples being described as currying in some places, and partial application in others.</p>

<p>Could someone provide me with a definition of both terms, and details of how they differ?</p>

"<p>I'm looking for (simple) examples of problems for which JMS is a good solution, and also reasons why JMS is a good solution in these cases. In the past I've simply used the database as a means of passing messages from A to B when the message cannot necessarily be processed by B immediately.</p>

<p>A hypothetical example of such a system is where all newly registered users should be sent a welcome e-mail within 24 hours of registration. For the sake of argument, assume the DB does not record the time when each user registered, but instead a reference (foreign key) to each new user is stored in the pending_email table. The e-mail sender job runs once every 24 hours, sends an e-mail to all the users in this table, then deletes all the pending_email records.</p>

<p>This seems like the kind of problem for which JMS should be used, but it's not clear to me what benefit JMS would have over the approach I've described. One advantage of the DB approach is that the messages are persistent. I understand that JMS message queues can also be persisted, but in that case there seems to be little difference between JMS and the ""database as message queue"" approach I've described?</p>

"<p>First, I know about this: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/51217/how-would-you-organize-a-subversion-repository-for-in-house-software-projects"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/51217/how-would-you-organize-a-subversion-repository-for-in-house-software-projects</a>
Next, the actual question:
My team is restructuring our repository and I'm looking for hints on how to organize it. (SVN in this case).
Here's what we came up with. We have one repository, multiple projects and multiple svn:externals cross-references</p>

<pre><code>\commonTools /*tools used in all projects. Referenced in each project with svn:externals*/
   \NUnit.v2.4.8
   \NCover.v.1.5.8
   \&lt;other similar tools&gt;
\commonFiles /*settings strong name keys etc.*/
   \ReSharper.settings
   \VisualStudio.settings
\thrash /*each member of the team has thrash for samples, experiments etc*/
   \user1
   \user2
\projects
   \Solution1 /*Single actual project (Visual Studio Solution)*/
      \trunk
         \src
             \Project1 /*Each sub-project resulting in single .dll or .exe*/
             \Project2
         \lib
         \tools
         \tests
         \Solution1.sln
      \tags
      \branches
   \Solution2
      \trunk
         \src
             \Project3 /*Each sub-project resulting in single .dll or .exe*/
             \Project1 /*Project1 from Solution1 references with svn:externals*/
         \lib
         \tools
         \tests
         \Solution2.sln
      \tags
      \branches
</code></pre>

<p>To clear the vocabulary: Solution means single product, Project is a Visual Studio Project (that results in a single .dll or single .exe)</p>

<p>That's how we plan to lay out the repository. The main issue is, that we have multiple Solutions, but we want to share Projects among Solutions.
We thought that there is no point really in moving those shared Projects to their own Solutions, and instead we decided to use svn:externals to share Projects among Solutions. We also want to keep common set of tools and 3rd party libraries in one place in the repository, and them reference them in each Solution with svn:externals.</p>

<p>What do you think about this layout? Especially about the use of svn:externals. It's not an ideal solution, but considering all pros and cons, it's the best we could think of. How would YOU do it?</p>

"<p>This question comes up occasionally, but I haven't seen a satisfactory answer.</p>

<p>A typical pattern is (row is a <strong>DataRow</strong>):</p>

<pre><code> if (row[""value""] != DBNull.Value)
 {
      someObject.Member = row[""value""];
 }
</code></pre>

<p>My first question is which is more efficient (I've flipped the condition):</p>

<pre><code>  row[""value""] == DBNull.Value; // Or
  row[""value""] is DBNull; // Or
  row[""value""].GetType() == typeof(DBNull) // Or... any suggestions?
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/184681/is-vs-typeof"">This</a> indicates that .GetType() should be faster, but maybe the compiler knows a few tricks I don't?</p>

<p>Second question, is it worth caching the value of row[""value""] or does the compiler optimize the indexer away anyway?</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>  object valueHolder;
  if (DBNull.Value == (valueHolder = row[""value""])) {}
</code></pre>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ol>
<li>row[""value""] exists.</li>
<li>I don't know the column index of the column (hence the column name lookup).</li>
<li>I'm asking specifically about checking for DBNull and then assignment (not about premature optimization, etc.).</li>
</ol>

<p>I benchmarked a few scenarios (time in seconds, 10,000,000 trials):</p>

<pre><code>row[""value""] == DBNull.Value: 00:00:01.5478995
row[""value""] is DBNull: 00:00:01.6306578
row[""value""].GetType() == typeof(DBNull): 00:00:02.0138757
</code></pre>

<p>Object.ReferenceEquals has the same performance as ""==""</p>

<p>The most interesting result? If you mismatch the name of the column by case (for example, ""Value"" instead of ""value"", it takes roughly ten times longer (for a string):</p>

<pre><code>row[""Value""] == DBNull.Value: 00:00:12.2792374
</code></pre>

<p>The moral of the story seems to be that if you can't look up a column by its index, then ensure that the column name you feed to the indexer matches the DataColumn's name exactly.</p>

<p>Caching the value also appears to be nearly <strong>twice</strong> as fast:</p>

<pre><code>No Caching: 00:00:03.0996622
With Caching: 00:00:01.5659920
</code></pre>

<p>So the most efficient method <em>seems</em> to be:</p>

<pre><code> object temp;
 string variable;
 if (DBNull.Value != (temp = row[""value""]))
 {
      variable = temp.ToString();
 }
</code></pre>

"<p>I have something here that is really catching me off guard.</p>

<p>I have an ObservableCollection of T that is filled with items. I also have an event handler attached to the CollectionChanged event.</p>

<p>When you <strong>Clear</strong> the collection it causes an CollectionChanged event with e.Action set to NotifyCollectionChangedAction.Reset. Ok, that's normal. But what is weird is that neither e.OldItems or e.NewItems has anything in it. <strong>I would expect e.OldItems to be filled with all items that were removed from the collection.</strong></p>

<p>Has anyone else seen this? And if so, how have they gotten around it?</p>

<p>Some background: I am using the CollectionChanged event to attach and detach from another event and thus if I don't get any items in e.OldItems ... I won't be able to detach from that event.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p><strong>CLARIFICATION:</strong>
I do know that the documentation doesn't <em>outright</em> state that it has to behave this way. But for every other action, it is notifying me of what it has done. So, my assumption is that it would tell me ... in the case of Clear/Reset as well.</p>

"<p>I have  a requirement to install multiple web setup projects (using VS2005 and ASP.Net/C#) into the same virtual folder.  The projects share some assembly references (the file systems are all structured to use the same 'bin' folder), making deployment of changes to those assemblies problematic since the MS installer will only overwrite assemblies if the currently installed version is older than the one in the MSI.</p>

<p>I'm not suggesting that the pessimistic installation scheme is wrong - only that it creates a problem in the environment I've been given to work with.  Since there are a sizable number of common assemblies and a significant number of developers who might change a common assembly but forget to update its version number, trying to manage versioning manually will eventually lead to massive confusion at install time.</p>

<p>On the flip side of this issue, it's also important not to spontaneously update version numbers and replace <em>all</em> common assemblies with <em>every</em> install, since that could (temporarily at least) obscure cases where actual changes were made.</p>

<p>That said, what I'm looking for is a means to update assembly version information (preferably using MSBuild) only in cases where the assembly constituents (code modules, resources etc) has/have actually changed.</p>

<p>I've found a few references that are at least partially pertinent <a href=""http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/AssemblyInfoTaskvers/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=232"">here </a> (AssemblyInfo task on MSDN) and <a href=""http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msbuild/thread/94054d89-ba19-4658-9e4e-ce7d8ff4dea3/"">here</a> (looks similar to what I need, but more than two years old and without a clear solution).</p>

<p>My team also uses TFS version control, so an automated solution should probably include a means by which the AssebmlyInfo can be checked out/in during the build.</p>

<p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>

According to <a href=""http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/list/size.html"">some</a> <a href=""http://bytes.com/forum/thread60248.html"">sources</a>, this is in fact implementation dependent as the standard doesn't say what the complexity has to be.<br>
The comment <a href=""http://ahlamnote.blogspot.com/2006/11/stl-list-size-method-is-slow.html"">in this blog entry</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Actually, it depends on which STL you
  are using. Microsoft Visual Studio V6
  implements size() as {return (_Size);
  } whereas gcc (at least in versions
  3.3.2 and 4.1.0) do it as { return std::distance(begin(), end()); } The
  first has constant speed, the second
  has o(N) speed</p>

I have a fairly good idea how I'm going to do this, but am not sure if I'll be able to integrate it well into the pre-built admin interface. </p>

<p>I've done absolutely zero Django development otherwise I'd probably have a better idea on whether this would work or not. I probably won't use Django if the generated admin interface is going to be useless to this project - but like I said, there is a heavy reliance on fine-grained custom permissions.</p>

<p>Will Django let me build custom permissions/rules and integrate it seamlessly into the admin CRUD interface?</p>

<p>Update One: I want to use the admin app to minimise the repitition of generating CRUD interfaces, so yes I consider it a must have.</p>

<p>Update Two:</p>

<p>I want to describe the permissions required for this project.</p>

<p>A client can belong to one or many 'stores'. Full time employees should only be able to edit clients at their store (even if they belong to another store). However, they should not be able to see/edit clients at another store. Casuals should only be able to view clients based on what store they are rostered too (or if the casual is logged in as the store user - more likely).</p>

<p>Management above them need to be able to see all employees for the stores they manage, nothing more.</p>

<p>Senior management should be able to edit ALL employees and grant permissions below themselves.</p>

<p>After reading the django documentation, it says you can't (autmoatically) set permissions for a sub-set of a group. Only the entire group. Is it easy enough to mock up your own permissions for this purpose?</p>

"<p>I need to compare 2 strings as equal such as these:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lubeck == Lübeck</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In JavaScript.</p>

<p>Why? Well, I have an auto-completion field that's going out to a Java service using Lucene, where place names are stored naturally (as Lübeck), but also indexed as normalized text, </p>

<pre><code>import sun.text.Normalizer;
oDoc.setNameLC = Normalizer.normalize(oLocName, Normalizer.DECOMP, 0)
    .toLowerCase().replaceAll(""[^\\p{ASCII}]"","""");

<p>This way some-one who doesn't know to type ""Mèxico"" can type ""mexico"" and get a match which returns ""Mèxico"" (among a lot of other possible hits, like ""Café Mèxico, Dubai, UAE"").</p>

<p>Now the thing is I don't have the ability to change the service to do any highlighting on the server side, therefore I am highlighting on the client JavaScript side with something like:</p>

<pre><code>return result.replace( input.replace(/[aeiou]/g,"".""), ""&lt;b&gt;$1&lt;/b&gt;"");
</code></pre>

<p>It's a little more fancy because I am escaping special regex characters in the input. This is fine for simple one word matches at the beginning of a hit, but it really breaks down if you suddenly wish to support multi-word matches like ""london cafe"":</p>

<pre><code>input = input.strip().toLowerCase(); //fyi prototype's strip is like trim
re = new RegEx(input.replace(/[aeiou]/g,""."").replace(/\s+/g,""|""),""gi"");
return result.replace(re, ""&lt;b&gt;$1&lt;/b&gt;"");

<p>Therefore I'm sort of looking for something that's not as crazy as:</p>

<pre><code>input = input.strip().toLowerCase();
input = input.replace(/a/g,""[ÀàÁáÂâÃãÄäÅåÆæĀāĂăĄą]"");
input = input.replace(/e/g,""[ÈèÉéÊêËëĒēĔĕĖėĘęĚě]"");
// ditto for i, o, u, y, c, n, maybe also d, g, h, j, k, l, r, s, t, w, z 
re = new RegEx(input.replace(/\s+/g,""|""),""gi"");
return result.replace(re, ""&lt;b&gt;$1&lt;/b&gt;"");

This seems like it makes the logic far more complex to understand than just passing back and forth thin models to service layer objects, but I've heard many ""wise men"" recommending this sort of structure.</p>

"<p>I recently started learning Python and I was rather surprised to find a 1000 deep recursion limit (by default).  If you set it high enough, about 30000, it crashes with a segmentation fault just like C.  Although, C seems to go quite a lot higher.</p>

<p>(The Python folks are quick to point out that you can always convert recursive functions to iterative ones and that they're always faster.  That's 100% true.  It's not really what my question is about though.)</p>

<p>I tried the same experiment in Perl and somewhere around 10 million recursions it consumed all of my 4 gigs of ram and I used ^C to stop trying.  Clearly Perl doesn't use the C stack, but it does use a ridiculous amount of memory when it recurses -- not terribly shocking considering how much work it has to do to call functions.</p>

<p>I tried in Pike and was completely surprised to get 100,000,000 recursions in about 2 seconds.  I have no idea how it did that, but I suspect it flattened the recursion to an iterative process -- it doesn't seem to consume any extra memory while it does it. [Note: Pike does flatten trivial cases, but segfaults on more complicated ones, or so I'm told.]</p>

<p>I used these otherwise useless functions:</p>

<pre><code>int f(int i, int l) { if(i&lt;l) return f(i+1,l); return i; }

sub f { return f($_[0]+1, $_[1]) if $_[0]&lt;$_[1]; return $_[0] };

def f(i,l):
   if i&lt;l:
     return f(i+1,l)
   return i
</code></pre>

<p>I'm very curious how other languages (e.g., PHP, Ruby, Java, Lua, Ocaml, Haskell) handle recursion and why they handle it that way.  Additionally, please note whether it makes a difference if the function is ""tail-recursive"" (see comment).</p>

"<p>We have a function which a single thread calls into (we name this the main thread). Within the body of the function we spawn multiple worker threads to do CPU intensive work, wait for all threads to finish, then return the result on the main thread.</p>

"<p><strong>The Background</strong></p>

<p>I started a Rails project recently and decided to use RESTful controllers. I created controllers for my key entities (such as Country) and added index, new, edit, create, show, update, delete. I added my map.resources :country to my routes file and life was good.</p>

<p>After development progressed a little, I started to encounter problems... I sometimes needed extra actions in my controller. First there was the <strong><em>search</em></strong> action that returned the options for my fancy autocompleting search box. Then came the need to display the countries in two different ways in different places in the application (the data displayed was different too, so it wasn't just two views) - I added the <strong><em>index_full</em></strong> action. Then I wanted to show a country by name in the URL, not by id so I added the <strong><em>show_by_name</em></strong> action.</p>

<p><strong>The Question</strong></p>

<p>What do you do when you need actions beyond the standard index, new, edit, create, show, update, delete in a RESTful controller in Rails? Do I need to add (and maintain) manual routes in the routes.rb file (which is a pain), do they go in a different controller, do I become unRESTful or am I missing something fundamental?</p>

<p><strong>Clarification</strong></p>

<p>I guess I am asking, do I need to work harder and add actions into my routes.rb file for the privilege of being RESTful? If I wasn't using map.resources to add the REST goodies, the standard :controller/:action, :controller/:action/:id routes would handle pretty much everything automatically.</p>

"<p>We're all familiar with the horror that is C# event declaration.  To ensure thread-safety, <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/archive/2005/01/14/353132.aspx"">the standard is to write something like this</a>:</p>

<pre><code>public event EventHandler SomethingHappened;
protected virtual void OnSomethingHappened(EventArgs e)
{            
    var handler = SomethingHappened;
    if (handler != null)
        handler(this, e);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Recently in some other question on this board (which I can't find now), someone pointed out that extension methods could be used nicely in this scenario.  Here's one way to do it:</p>

<pre><code>static public class EventExtensions
{
    static public void RaiseEvent(this EventHandler @event, object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        var handler = @event;
        if (handler != null)
            handler(sender, e);
    }
    static public void RaiseEvent&lt;T&gt;(this EventHandler&lt;T&gt; @event, object sender, T e)
        where T : EventArgs
    {
        var handler = @event;
        if (handler != null)
            handler(sender, e);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>With these extension methods in place, all you need to declare and raise an event is something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public event EventHandler SomethingHappened;

void SomeMethod()
{
    this.SomethingHappened.RaiseEvent(this, EventArgs.Empty);
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code>mCapHwnd = capCreateCaptureWindowA(""WebCap"", 0, 0, 0, 320, 240, 1024, 0);

SendMessage(mCapHwnd, WM_CAP_CONNECT, 0, 0);
SendMessage(mCapHwnd, WM_CAP_SET_PREVIEW, 0, 0);
</code></pre>

<p>And this is what I use to copy the image to the clipboard:</p>

<pre><code>SendMessage(mCapHwnd, WM_CAP_GET_FRAME, 0, 0);

SendMessage(mCapHwnd, WM_CAP_COPY, 0, 0);
tempObj = Clipboard.GetDataObject();
tempImg = (System.Drawing.Bitmap)tempObj.GetData(System.Windows.Forms.DataFormats.Bitmap);
</code></pre>

"<p>After reading <a href=""http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/javatips/jw-javatip130.html?page=2"">this old article</a> measuring the memory consumption of several object types, I was amazed to see how much memory <code>String</code>s use in Java:</p>

<pre><code>length: 0, {class java.lang.String} size = 40 bytes
length: 7, {class java.lang.String} size = 56 bytes
</code></pre>

<p>While the article has some tips to minimize this, I did not find them entirely satisfying. It seems to be wasteful to use <code>char[]</code> for storing the data. The obvious improvement for most western languages would be to use <code>byte[]</code> and an encoding like UTF-8 instead, as you only need a single byte to store the most frequent characters then instead of two bytes.</p>

<p>Of course one could use <code>String.getBytes(""UTF-8"")</code> and <code>new String(bytes, ""UTF-8"")</code>. Even the overhead of the String instance itself would be gone. But then there you lose very handy methods like <code>equals()</code>, <code>hashCode()</code>, <code>length()</code>, ...</p>

<p>Sun has a <a href=""http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6751790.html"">patent</a> on <code>byte[]</code> representation of Strings, as far as I can tell. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Frameworks for efficient representation of string objects in Java programming environments</strong><br>
  ... The techniques can be implemented to create Java string objects as arrays of one-byte characters when it is appropriate ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I failed to find an API for that patent.</p>

<p>Why do I care?<br>
In most cases I don't. But I worked on applications with huge caches, containing lots of Strings, which would have benefitted from using the memory more efficiently.</p>

<p>Does anybody know of such an API? Or is there another way to keep your memory footprint for Strings small, even at the cost of CPU performance or uglier API?</p>

<p>Please don't repeat the suggestions from the above article:</p>

<ul>
<li>own variant of <code>String.intern()</code> (possibly with <code>SoftReferences</code>)</li>
<li>storing a single <code>char[]</code> and exploiting the current <code>String.subString(.)</code> implementation to avoid data copying (nasty)</li>

</blockquote>

<p>I'm interesting in tinkering with a 2D fighting/platforming game as a side project sometime.  I'm primarily a Linux server-side programmer with experience in Python, Ruby and PHP.  I know that there are excellent frameworks in some of these languages, like <a href=""http://www.pygame.org/news.html"" rel=""nofollow"">PyGame</a>.  I am also aware of the success people have had with stuff like Air and .NET... but I have some concerns:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Performance</strong>: Scripting languages are notoriously slow.  If I'm making a real-time game, I want it to be as snappy as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Huge binaries</strong>: Using frameworks like .NET or scripting languages like Ruby often result in big CLRs or libraries that you wouldn't otherwise need.  The game I want to make will be small and simple--I don't want its CLR to be bigger than the game itself!</li>
<li><strong>Extra stuff</strong>: Honestly, I just don't like the idea of inheriting some big game library's baggage if I can wrap my head around my own code better.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm asking this question because I know I'm very susceptible to Not Invented Here Syndrome.  I always want to program it myself, and I'm sure it wastes a lot of time.  However, this works out for me remarkably often--for example, instead of using <a href=""http://www.rubyonrails.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Rails</a> (a very big web project framework with an ORM and GUI toolkit baked in), I used an array of smaller Ruby tools like <a href=""http://rack.rubyforge.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">rack</a> and <a href=""http://sequel.rubyforge.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">sequel</a> that fit together beautifully.</p>

<p>So, I turn to you, SO experts.  Am I being naive?  Here's how I see it:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Use C</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cons</strong>
<ul>
<li>Will probably make me hate programming</li>
<li>High risk of reinventing wheels</li>
<li>High risk of it taking so long that I lose interest</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Pros</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tried &amp; true - most A-list games are done in C (is this still true today?)</li>
<li>High level of control over memory management, speed, asset management, etc., which I trust myself to learn to handle</li>
<li>No cruft</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Use framework or SDK</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cons</strong>
<ul>
<li>Risk of oversized deliverable</li>
<li>Dependent on original library authors for all facets of game development--what if there isn't a feature I want?  I'll have to program it myself, which isn't bad, but partially defeats the purpose of using a high-level framework in the first place</li>
<li>High risk of performance issues</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Pros</strong>
<ul>
<li>MUCH faster development time</li>
<li>Might be easier to maintain</li>
<li>No time wasted reinventing common paradigms</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>[ UPDATE: Reviews ]</strong></p>

<p>OK, so I have spent a fair amount of time looking into (mainly free) .NET POP3 libraries so I thought I'd provide a short review of some of those mentioned below and a few others:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://weblogs.shockbyte.com.ar/rodolfof/archive/2008/07/07/pop3.net-library.aspx"">Pop3.net</a> - free - works OK, very basic in terms of functionality provided. This is pretty much just the POP3 commands and some base64 encoding, but it's very straight forward - probably a good introduction</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.componentsource.com/products/seekford-net-pop3-wizard/index.html"">Pop3 Wizard</a> - commercial / some open source code - couldn't get this to build, missing DLLs, I wouldn't bother with this </li>
<li><a href=""http://www.codeplex.com/csharpmail"">C#Mail</a> - free for personal use - works well, comes with Mime parser and SMTP client, however the comments are in Japanese (not a big deal) and it didn't work with SSL 'out of the box' - I had to change the SslStream constructor after which it worked no problem</li>
<li><a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/hpop/"">OpenPOP</a> - free - hasn't been updated for about 5 years so it's current state is .NET 1.0, doesn't support SSL but that was no problem to resolve - I just replaced the existing stream with an SslStream and it worked. Comes with Mime parser.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of the free libraries, I'd go for C#Mail or OpenPOP.</p>

<p>I looked at a few commercial libraries: <a href=""http://www.chilkatsoft.com/"">Chillkat</a>, <a href=""http://www.rebex.net/"">Rebex</a>, <a href=""http://remobjects.com/"">RemObjects</a>, <a href=""http://tech.dimac.net/default2.asp?M=Products/MenuDOTNET.asp&amp;P=Products/JMaildotnet/start.htm"">JMail.net</a>. Based on features, price and impression of the company I would probably go for Rebex and may in the future if my requirements change or I run into production issues with either of C#Mail or OpenPOP.</p>

<p>In case anyone's needs it, this is the replacement SslStream constructor that I used to enable SSL with C#Mail and OpenPOP:</p>

<pre><code>SslStream stream = new SslStream(clientSocket.GetStream(), false,
                 delegate(object sender, X509Certificate cert,
                 X509Chain chain, SslPolicyErrors errors) { return true; });

"<p>I recently stumbled across <a href=""http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2008/08/by-miko-hevery-so-you-decided-to.html"">this entry in the google testing blog</a> about guidelines for writing more testable code.  I was in agreement with the author until this point:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Favor polymorphism over conditionals: If you see a switch statement you should think polymorphisms. If you see the same if condition repeated in many places in your class you should again think polymorphism. Polymorphism will break your complex class into several smaller simpler classes which clearly define which pieces of the code are related and execute together. This helps testing since simpler/smaller class is easier to test.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I simply cannot wrap my head around that.  I can understand using polymorphism instead of RTTI (or DIY-RTTI, as the case may be), but that seems like such a broad statement that I can't imagine it actually being used effectively in production code.  It seems to me, rather, that it would be easier to add additional test cases for methods which have switch statements, rather than breaking down the code into dozens of separate classes.</p>

<p>Also, I was under the impression that polymorphism can lead to all sorts of other subtle bugs and design issues, so I'm curious to know if the tradeoff here would be worth it.  Can someone explain to me exactly what is meant by this testing guideline?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I am familiar with options like caching, switching to static content or a content delivery network, and so on as a means to survive, so perhaps the question should focus more on how one detects when the website is about to become overloaded.  (Although answers on other survival methods are of course still more than welcome.)  Lets say that the website is running Apache on Linux and PHP.  This is probably the most common configuration and should allow the maximum number of people to gain assistance from the answers.  Lets also assume that expensive options like buying another server and load balancing are unavailable - for most of us at least, a mention on Slashdot is going to be a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence, and not something we can spend money preparing for.</p>

"<p><em>What options are there to detect web-crawlers that do not want to be detected?</em></p>

<p>(I know that listing detection techniques will allow the smart stealth-crawler programmer to make a better spider, but I do not think that we will ever be able to block smart stealth-crawlers anyway, only the ones that make mistakes.)</p>

<p>I'm not talking about the nice crawlers such as googlebot and Yahoo! Slurp.
I consider a bot nice if it:</p>

<ol>
<li>identifies itself as a bot in the user agent string</li>
<li>reads robots.txt (and obeys it)</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm talking about the <em>bad</em> crawlers, hiding behind common user agents, using my bandwidth and never giving me anything in return.</p>

<p>There are some trapdoors that can be constructed <em>updated list (thanks Chris, gs)</em>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Adding a directory only listed (marked as disallow) in the robots.txt,</li>
<li>Adding invisible links (possibly marked as rel=""nofollow""?),
<ul>
<li>style=""display: none;"" on link or parent container</li>
<li>placed underneath another element with higher z-index</li>
</ul></li>
<li>detect who doesn't understand CaPiTaLiSaTioN,</li>
<li>detect who tries to post replies but always fail the Captcha.</li>
<li>detect GET requests to POST-only resources</li>
<li>detect interval between requests</li>
<li>detect order of pages requested</li>
<li>detect who (consistently) requests https resources over http</li>
<li>detect who does not request image file (this in combination with a list of user-agents of known image capable browsers works surprisingly nice)</li>
</ol>

<p>Some traps would be triggered by both 'good' and 'bad' bots.
you could combine those with a whitelist:</p>

<ol>
<li>It trigger a trap</li>
<li>It request <code>robots.txt</code>? </li>
<li>It doest not trigger another trap because it obeyed <code>robots.txt</code></li>
</ol>

<p><em>One other important thing here is:</em><br />
Please consider blind people using a screen readers: give people a way to contact you, or solve a (non-image) Captcha to continue browsing.</p>

<p><strong>What methods are there to automatically detect the web crawlers trying to mask themselves as normal human visitors.</strong></p>

<p><em>Update</em><br />
The question is not: <em>How do I catch every crawler.</em> The question is: <em>How can I maximize the chance of detecting a crawler.</em>  </p>

<p>Some spiders are really good, and actually parse and understand html, xhtml, css javascript, VB script etc...<br />
I have no illusions: I won't be able to beat them.</p>

<p>You would however be surprised how stupid some crawlers are. With the best example  of stupidity (in my opinion) being: cast all URLs to lower case before requesting them.</p>

<p>And then there is a whole bunch of crawlers that are just 'not good enough' to avoid the various trapdoors.</p>

"<p>Let's suppose I'm using the Northwind database and I would like to run a query via a stored procedure that contains, among other parameters, the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>@Offset</code> to indicate where the pagination starts,</li>
<li><code>@Limit</code> to indicate the page size,</li>
<li><code>@SortColumn</code> to indicate the column used for sorting purposes,</li>
<li><code>@SortDirection</code>, to indicate ascendant or descendant sorting.</li>
</ul>

<p>The idea is to do the pagination on the database, as the result set contains thousands of rows so caching is not an option (and using VIEWSTATE is not even considered as, IMO, sucks).</p>

<p>As you may know SQL Server 2005 provides the function <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms186734.aspx"">ROW_NUMBER</a> which <em>returns the sequential number of a row within a partition of a result set, starting at 1 for the first row in each partition</em>.</p>

<p>We need sorting on every returned column (five in this example) and dynamic SQL is not an option, so we have two possibilities: using plenty of <code>IF ... ELSE ...</code> and having 10 queries, which is a hell to maintain, or having a query like the following:</p>

<pre><code>WITH PaginatedOrders AS (
	SELECT
		CASE (@SortColumn + ':' + @SortDirection)
			WHEN 'OrderID:A' THEN ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Orders.OrderID ASC)
			WHEN 'OrderID:D' THEN ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Orders.OrderID DESC)
			WHEN 'CustomerID:A' THEN ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Orders.CustomerID ASC)
			WHEN 'CustomerID:D' THEN ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Orders.CustomerID DESC)
			WHEN 'EmployeeID:A' THEN ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Orders.EmployeeID ASC)
			WHEN 'EmployeeID:D' THEN ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Orders.EmployeeID DESC)
			WHEN 'OrderDate:A' THEN ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Orders.OrderDate ASC)
			WHEN 'OrderDate:D' THEN ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Orders.OrderDate DESC)
			WHEN 'ShippedDate:A' THEN ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Orders.OrderID ASC)
			WHEN 'ShippedDate:D' THEN ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Orders.OrderID DESC)
		END AS RowNumber,
		OrderID, CustomerID, EmployeeID, OrderDate, ShippedDate
	FROM Orders
	-- WHERE clause goes here
)
SELECT
	RowNumber, OrderID, CustomerID, EmployeeID, OrderDate, ShippedDate,
	@Offset, @Limit, @SortColumn, @SortDirection
FROM PaginatedOrders
WHERE RowNumber BETWEEN @Offset AND (@Offset + @Limit - 1)
ORDER BY RowNumber
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried the query several times, with different arguments, and its performance it is quite good actually, but it stills looks like it might be optimized some other way.</p>

<p>Is anything wrong with this query or you would do it this way? Do you propose a different approach?</p>

"<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11"">C++11</a> introduces <a href=""http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2378.pdf"">user-defined literals</a> which will allow the introduction of new literal syntax based on existing literals (<code>int</code>, <code>hex</code>, <code>string</code>, <code>float</code>) so that any type will be able to have a literal presentation.</p>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>

<pre><code>// imaginary numbers
std::complex&lt;long double&gt; operator """" _i(long double d) // cooked form
{ 
    return std::complex&lt;long double&gt;(0, d); 
}
auto val = 3.14_i; // val = complex&lt;long double&gt;(0, 3.14)

// binary values
int operator """" _B(const char*); // raw form
int answer = 101010_B; // answer = 42

// std::string
std::string operator """" _s(const char* str, size_t /*length*/) 
{ 
    return std::string(str); 
}

auto hi = ""hello""_s + "" world""; // + works, ""hello""_s is a string not a pointer

// units
assert(1_kg == 2.2_lb); // give or take 0.00462262 pounds
</code></pre>

<p>At first glance this looks very cool but I'm wondering how applicable it really is, when I tried to think of having the suffixes <code>_AD</code> and <code>_BC</code> create dates I found that it's problematic due to operator order. <code>1974/01/06_AD</code> would first evaluate <code>1974/01</code> (as plain <code>int</code>s) and only later the <code>06_AD</code> (to say nothing of August and September having to be written without the <code>0</code> for octal reasons). This can be worked around by having the syntax be <code>1974-1/6_AD</code> so that the operator evaluation order works but it's clunky. </p>

<p>So what my question boils down to is this, do you feel this feature will justify itself? What other literals would you like to define that will make your C++ code more readable?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Since this time the Jenkins project has replaced Hudson as the community version of the package. The original authors have moved to this project as well. Jenkins is now a standard package on Ubuntu/Debian, RedHat/Fedora/CentOS, and others. The following update is still essentially correct. The starting point to do this with <a href=""http://jenkins-ci.org"">Jenkins</a> is different.</p>

<p><strong><em>Update:</em></strong> After trying a few alternatives, I think I'll stick with Hudson. <a href=""http://integrityapp.com/"">Integrity</a> was nice and simple, but quite limited. I think <a href=""http://buildbot.net/trac"">Buildbot</a> is better suited to having numerous build-slaves, rather than everything running on a single machine like I was using it.</p>

<p>Setting Hudson up for a Python project was pretty simple:</p>

<ul>
<li>Download Hudson from <a href=""http://hudson-ci.org/"">http://hudson-ci.org/</a></li>
<li>Run it with <code>java -jar hudson.war</code></li>
<li>Open the web interface on the default address of <code>http://localhost:8080</code></li>
<li>Go to Manage Hudson, Plugins, click ""Update"" or similar</li>
<li>Install the Git plugin (I had to set the <code>git</code> path in the Hudson global preferences)</li>
<li>Create a new project, enter the repository, SCM polling intervals and so on</li>
<li>Install <code>nosetests</code> via <code>easy_install</code> if it's not already</li>
<li>In the a build step, add <code>nosetests --with-xunit --verbose</code></li>
<li>Check ""Publish JUnit test result report"" and set ""Test report XMLs"" to <code>**/nosetests.xml</code></li>
</ul>

<p>That's all that's required. You can setup email notifications, and <a href=""http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Plugins"">the plugins</a> are worth a look. A few I'm currently using for Python projects:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href=""http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Violations"">Violations</a> to parse the PyLint output (you can setup warning thresholds, graph the number of violations over each build)</li>
<li><a href=""http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Cobertura+Plugin"">Cobertura</a> can parse the coverage.py output. Nosetest can gather coverage while running your tests, using <code>nosetests --with-coverage</code> (this writes the output to <code>**/coverage.xml</code>)</li>

"<p>What is people's prefered method of storing application configuration data in a database. From having done this in the past myself, I've utilised two ways of doing it.</p>

<ol>
<li>You can create a table where you store key/value pairs, where key is the name of the config option and value is its value. Pro's of this is adding new values is easy and you can use the same routines to set/get data. Downsides are you have untyped data as the value.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can hardcode a configuration table, with each column being the name of the value and its datatype. The downside to this is more maintenance setting up new values, but it allows you to have typed data.</li>

"<p>I have seen various rules for naming stored procedures. </p>

<p>Some people prefix the sproc name with usp_, others with an abbreviation for the app name, and still others with an owner name. You shouldn't use sp_ in SQL Server unless you really mean it.</p>

<p>Some start the proc name with a verb (Get, Add, Save, Remove). Others emphasize the entity name(s).</p>

<p>On a database with hundreds of sprocs, it can be very hard to scroll around and find a suitable sproc when you think one already exists. Naming conventions can make locating a sproc easier.</p>

<p>Do you use a naming convention? Please describe it, and explain why you prefer it over other choices.</p>

<p><strong>Summary of replies:</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>Everybody seems to advocate consistency of naming, that it might be more important for everyone to use the same naming convention than which particular one is used.</li>
<li>Prefixes: While a lot of folks use usp_ or something similar (but rarely sp_), many others use database or app name. One clever DBA uses gen, rpt and tsk to distinguish general CRUD sprocs from those used for reporting or tasks.</li>
<li>Verb + Noun seems to be slightly more popular than Noun + Verb. Some people use the SQL keywords (Select, Insert, Update, Delete) for the verbs, while others use non-SQL verbs (or abbreviations for them) like Get and Add. Some distinguish between singluar and plural nouns to indicate whether one or many records are being retrieved.</li>
<li>An additional phrase is suggested at the end, where appropriate. GetCustomerById, GetCustomerBySaleDate.</li>
<li>Some people use underscores between the name segments, and some avoid underscores. app_ Get_Customer vs. appGetCustomer -- I guess it's a matter of readability.</li>
<li>Large collections of sprocs can be segregated into Oracle packages or Management Studio (SQL Server) solutions and projects, or SQL Server schemas.</li>
<li>Inscrutable abbreviations should be avoided.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why I choose the answer I did:</strong> There are SO many good responses. Thank you all! As you can see, it would be very hard to choose just one. The one I chose resonated with me. I have followed the same path he describes -- trying to use Verb + Noun and then not being able to find all of the sprocs that apply to Customer. </p>

<p>Being able to locate an existing sproc, or to determine if one even exists, is very important. Serious problems can arise if someone inadvertently creates a duplicate sproc with another name. </p>

<p>Since I generally work on very large apps with hundreds of sprocs, I have a preference for the easiest-to-find naming method. For a smaller app, I might advocate Verb + Noun, as it follows the general coding convention for method names.</p>

<p>He also advocates prefixing with app name instead of the not very useful usp_. As several people pointed out, sometimes the database contains sprocs for multiple apps. So, prefixing with app name helps to segregate the sprocs AND helps DBAs and others to determine which app the sproc is used for.</p>

Our class realized that it would be impossible to write a perfect type checker (one that would accept all programs that would run without type errors, and reject all programs that would run with type errors) because this would, in fact, solve the halting problem. Another was when we realized, in the same class, that it would be impossible to determine whether a division would ever occur by zero, in the type-checking stage, because checking whether a number, at run-time, is zero, is also a version of the halting problem.</p>

"<p>I was watching Rob Connerys webcasts on the MVCStoreFront App, and I noticed he was unit testing even the most mundane things, things like:</p>

<pre><code>public Decimal DiscountPrice
{
   get
   {
       return this.Price - this.Discount;
   }
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code>[TestMethod]
public void Test_DiscountPrice
{
    Product p = new Product();
    p.Price = 100;
    p.Discount = 20;
    Assert.IsEqual(p.DiscountPrice,80);
}
</code></pre>

<p>While, I am all for unit testing, I sometimes wonder if this form of test first development is really beneficial, for example, in a real process, you have 3-4 layers above your code (Business Request, Requirements Document, Architecture Document), where the actual defined business rule (Discount Price is Price - Discount) could be misdefined.</p>

<p>If that's the situation, your unit test means nothing to you.</p>

<p>Additionally, your unit test is another point of failure:</p>

<pre><code>[TestMethod]
public void Test_DiscountPrice
{
    Product p = new Product();
    p.Price = 100;
    p.Discount = 20;
    Assert.IsEqual(p.DiscountPrice,90);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now the test is flawed. Obviously in a simple test, it's no big deal, but say we were testing a complicated business rule. What do we gain here?</p>

<p>Fast forward two years into the application's life, when maintenance developers are maintaining it. Now the business changes its rule, and the test breaks again, some rookie developer then fixes the test incorrectly...we now have another point of failure.</p>

<p>All I see is more possible points of failure, with no real beneficial return, if the discount price is wrong, the test team will still find the issue, how did unit testing save any work?</p>

<p>What am I missing here? Please teach me to love TDD, as I'm having a hard time accepting it as useful so far. I want too, because I want to stay progressive, but it just doesn't make sense to me.</p>

"<p>I'm getting started on building a REST API for a project I'm working on, and it led me to do a little research as to the best way to build an API using RoR. I find out pretty quickly that by default, models are open to the world and can be called via URL by simply putting a "".xml"" at the end of the URL and passing appropriate parameters.</p>

<p>So then the next question came. How do I secure my app to prevent unauthorized changes? In doing some research I found a couple articles talking about <code>attr_accessible</code> and <code>attr_protected</code> and how they can be used. The particular URL I found talking about these was posted back in May of '07 (<a href=""http://railscasts.com/episodes/26-hackers-love-mass-assignment"">here</a>). </p>

<p>As with all things ruby, I'm sure that things have evolved since then. So my question is, is this still the best way to secure a REST API within RoR?</p>

"<p>In this thread, we look at examples of good uses of <code>goto</code> in C or C++.  It's inspired by <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/244445/best-refactoring-for-the-dreaded-while-true-loop#244644"">an answer</a> which people voted up because they thought I was joking.</p>

<p>Summary (label changed from original to make intent even clearer):</p>

<pre><code>infinite_loop:

    // code goes here

goto infinite_loop;
</code></pre>

<p>Why it's better than the alternatives:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's specific.  <code>goto</code> is the
language construct which causes an
unconditional branch.  Alternatives
depend on using structures
supporting conditional branches,
with a degenerate always-true
condition.</li>
<li>The label documents the intent
without extra comments.</li>
<li>The reader doesn't have to scan the
intervening code for early <code>break</code>s
(although it's still possible for an
unprincipled hacker to simulate
<code>continue</code> with an early <code>goto</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Rules:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Pretend that the gotophobes didn't
win.  It's understood that the above
can't be used in real code because
it goes against established idiom.</li>
<li>Assume that we have all heard of
'Goto considered harmful' and know
that goto can be used to write
spaghetti code.</li>
<li>If you disagree with an example,
criticize it on technical merit
alone ('Because people don't like
goto' is not a technical reason).</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's see if we can talk about this like grown ups.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>This question seems finished now.  It generated some high quality answers.  Thanks to everyone,
 especially those who took my little loop example seriously.  Most skeptics were concerned
 by the lack of block scope.  As @quinmars pointed out in a comment, you can always put braces around the 
loop body.  I note in passing that <code>for(;;)</code> and <code>while(true)</code> don't give you the braces 
for free either (and omitting them can cause vexing bugs).  Anyway, I won't waste any more
of your brain power on this trifle - I can live with the harmless and idiomatic <code>for(;;)</code> and <code>while(true)</code> (just as well if I want to keep my job).  </p>

<p>Considering the other responses, I see that many people view <code>goto</code> as something you always 
have to rewrite in another way.  Of course you can avoid a <code>goto</code> by introducing a loop,
 an extra flag, a stack of nested <code>if</code>s, or whatever, but why not consider whether <code>goto</code> is 
perhaps the best tool for the job? Put another way, how much ugliness are people prepared to endure to avoid using a built-in language feature for its intended purpose? My take is that
even adding a flag is too high a price to pay.  I like my variables to represent things in 
the problem or solution domains. 'Solely to avoid a <code>goto</code>' doesn't cut it.</p>

<p>I'll accept the first answer which gave the C pattern for branching to a cleanup block. IMO, this makes the strongest case for a <code>goto</code> of all the posted answers, certainly 
if you measure it by the contortions a hater has to go through to avoid it.</p>

"<p>I'm pretty new to the Spring Framework, I've been playing around with it and putting a few samples apps together for the purposes of evaluating Spring MVC for use in an upcoming company project. So far I really like what I see in Spring MVC, seems very easy to use and encourages you to write classes that are very unit test-friendly.</p>

<p>Just as an exercise, I'm writing a main method for one of my sample/test projects. One thing I'm unclear about is the exact differences between <code>BeanFactory</code> and <code>ApplicationContext</code> - which is appropriate to use in which conditions?</p>

<p>I understand that <code>ApplicationContext</code> extends <code>BeanFactory</code>, but if I'm just writing a simple main method, do I need the extra functionality that <code>ApplicationContext</code> provides? And just exactly what kind of extra functionality does <code>ApplicationContext</code> provide?</p>

<p>In addition to answering ""which should I use in a main() method"", are there any standards or guidelines as far as which implementation I should use in such a scenario? Should my main() method be written to depend on the bean/application configuration to be in XML format - is that a safe assumption, or am I locking the user into something specific?</p>

<p>And does this answer change in a web environment - if any of my classes needed to be aware of Spring, are they more likely to need <code>ApplicationContext</code>?</p>

<p>Here is an example. Suppose we want to compute all the permutations of a string with a recursive function. The following naive algorithm takes an extra argument 'storage' and appends a permutation to it whenever it finds one:</p>

<pre><code>def getPermutations(string, storage, prefix=""""):
   if len(string) == 1:
      storage.append(prefix + string)   # &lt;-----

         getPermutations(string[:i]+string[i+1:], storage, prefix+string[i])

storage = []
getPermutations(""abcd"", storage)
for permutation in storage: print permutation
</code></pre>

<p>(Please don't care about inefficiency, this is only an example.)</p>

<p>Now I want to turn my function into a generator, i.e. to yield a permutation instead of appending it to the storage list:</p>

   if len(string) == 1:
      yield prefix + string             # &lt;-----

<p>This has stumped me, and any coworkers I've bugged for more than a day now.  Just to cull the answers, for now at least, third party solutions to this are probably out due to licensing restrictions and company policies (e.g.: tools for creating exe's or packaging up jars).  The ultimate goal is to create a jar that can be copied from my development Windows box to a Linux server (with any dependent jars) and used to populate a database (so classpaths may wind up being different between development and deployment environments).  Any clues to this mystery would be greatly appreciated!</p>

"<p>I have some code that raises <code>PropertyChanged</code> events and I would like to be able to unit test that the events are being raised correctly.</p>

<p>The code that is raising the events is like</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClass : INotifyPropertyChanged
{
   public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;  

   protected void NotifyPropertyChanged(String info)
   {
        if (PropertyChanged != null)
        {
            PropertyChanged(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(info));
        }
   }  

   public string MyProperty
   {
       set
       {
           if (_myProperty != value)
           {
               _myProperty = value;
               NotifyPropertyChanged(""MyProperty"");
           }
       }
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I get a nice green test from the following code in my unit tests, that uses delegates:</p>

<pre><code>[TestMethod]
public void Test_ThatMyEventIsRaised()
{
    string actual = null;
    MyClass myClass = new MyClass();

    myClass.PropertyChanged += delegate(object sender, PropertyChangedEventArgs e)
    {
         actual = e.PropertyName;
    };

    myClass.MyProperty = ""testing"";
    Assert.IsNotNull(actual);
    Assert.AreEqual(""MyProperty"", actual);
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, if I then try and chain the setting of properties together like so:</p>

<pre><code>public string MyProperty
{
    set
    {
        if (_myProperty != value)
        {
            _myProperty = value;
            NotifyPropertyChanged(""MyProperty"");
            MyOtherProperty = ""SomeValue"";
        }
    }
}

public string MyOtherProperty
{
    set
    {
        if (_myOtherProperty != value)
        {
            _myOtherProperty = value;
            NotifyPropertyChanged(""MyOtherProperty"");
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>My test for the event fails - the event that it captures is the event for the MyOtherProperty.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure the event fires, my UI reacts like it does, but my delegate only captures the last event to fire.</p>

<p>So I'm wondering:<br>
1. Is my method of testing events correct?<br>
2. Is my method of raising <em>chained</em> events correct?  </p>

"<p>Objective: take a UIImage, crop out a square in the middle, change size of square to 320x320 pixels, slice up the image into 16 80x80 images, save the 16 images in an array.</p>

<p>Here's my code:</p>

<pre><code>CGImageRef originalImage, resizedImage, finalImage, tmp;
float imgWidth, imgHeight, diff;
UIImage *squareImage, *playImage;
NSMutableArray *tileImgArray;
int r, c;

originalImage = [image CGImage];

imgWidth = image.size.width;
imgHeight = image.size.height;
diff = fabs(imgWidth - imgHeight);

if(imgWidth &gt; imgHeight){
	resizedImage = CGImageCreateWithImageInRect(originalImage, CGRectMake(floor(diff/2), 0, imgHeight, imgHeight));
}else{
	resizedImage = CGImageCreateWithImageInRect(originalImage, CGRectMake(0, floor(diff/2), imgWidth, imgWidth));
}
CGImageRelease(originalImage);

squareImage = [UIImage imageWithCGImage:resizedImage];		
if(squareImage.size.width != squareImage.size.height){
	NSLog(@""image cutout error!"");
	//*code to return to main menu of app, irrelevant here
}else{
	float newDim = squareImage.size.width;
	if(newDim != 320.0){
		CGSize finalSize = CGSizeMake(320.0, 320.0);
		UIGraphicsBeginImageContext(finalSize);
		[squareImage drawInRect:CGRectMake(0, 0, finalSize.width, finalSize.height)];
		playImage = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext();
		UIGraphicsEndImageContext();
	}else{
		playImage = squareImage;
	}
}

finalImage = [playImage CGImage];
tileImgArray = [NSMutableArray arrayWithCapacity:0];
for(int i = 0; i &lt; 16; i++){
	r = i/4;
	c = i%4;
	//*
	tmp = CGImageCreateWithImageInRect(finalImage, CGRectMake(c*tileSize, r*tileSize, tileSize, tileSize));
	[tileImgArray addObject:[UIImage imageWithCGImage:tmp]];
}
</code></pre>

<p>The code works correctly when the original (the variable image) has its smaller dimension either bigger or smaller than 320 pixels. When it's exactly 320, the resulting 80x80 images are almost entirely black, some with a few pixels at the edges that may (I can't really tell) be from the original image.</p>

<p>I tested by displaying the full image both directly:</p>

<pre><code>[UIImage imageWithCGImage:finalImage];
</code></pre>

<p>And indirectly:</p>

<pre><code>[UIImage imageWithCGImage:CGImageCreateWithImageInRect(finalImage, CGRectMake(0, 0, 320, 320))];
</code></pre>

<p>In both cases, the display worked. The problems only arise when I attempt to slice out some part of the image.</p>

"<p>My company, a C++ house, is always looking to hire recent grads. However due to the Java Schools phenomenon, we typically end up interviewing strong Java programmers with maybe a minute smattering of C++. Often the C++ classes don't really prepare students for working in C++. Nevertheless, often these are bright kids, eager to learn and do their best.</p>

<p>Every interview, I struggle with this fundamental question: </p>

<p>How hard is it to turn a ""Java School"" programmer into a C or  C++ programmer? Has your company had experience turning the stereotypical ""Java Schools"" programmer into a strong C++ programmer? Is it worth the effort?</p>

<p>One of the reasons I struggle with this is not just due to a C or C++ vs Java language difference, it's the fundamental skills that come with learning C or C++ that I think often get lost at the Java School. These include data structures, computational complexity, manual memory management, really everything Joel Spolsky says <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ThePerilsofJavaSchools.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Often, as far as I can tell, a student will have some of those fundamental skills (be able to answer a few questions), but I'll still have this large part of my mind that's extremely skeptical with how well someone can learn these skills without getting their hands dirty in some C or C++. Maybe I need to be disabused of this stereotype. Am I just being unfair?</p>

Some of these methods are static and short. Because most of the public methods make use of them, I will probably be able to safely remove the tests later. But for starting with a TDD approach and avoid debugging, I really want to test them.</p>

<li>Inherit a class with a testable interface making protected methods public</li>

"<p>I was watching <a href=""http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/TL16/"">Anders' talk about C# 4.0 and sneak preview of C# 5.0</a>, and it got me thinking about when optional parameters are available in C# what is going to be the recommended way to declare methods that do not need all parameters specified?</p>

<p>For example something like the <code>FileStream</code> class has about fifteen different constructors which can be divided into logical 'families' e.g. the ones below from a string, the ones from an <code>IntPtr</code> and the ones from a <code>SafeFileHandle</code>.</p>

<pre><code>FileStream(string,FileMode);
FileStream(string,FileMode,FileAccess);
FileStream(string,FileMode,FileAccess,FileShare);

FileStream(string,FileMode,FileAccess,FileShare,int,bool);

<p><strong><em>Update:</em></strong> as per changelog's suggestion i have tried adding the MS headers to the PEAR::mail class and i have tried replacing PEAR::mail with PHPMailer (with &amp; without the extra headers) - they all end up in the junk folder.</p>

<p>I am starting to believe that it may not be the headers afterall.</p>

"<p>Multimap essentially has groups of data sorted by the key. I want a method by which I could access these individual groups and get their aggregate values.
For example, in a <code>std::multimap&lt; string, int &gt;</code> I store </p>

<p>Having stored these values, I should be able to iterate this multimap and get the aggregate values of each ""group"". Problem is there aren't any functions defined in STL to access MultiMaps in such a way. I could use <code>lower_bound</code>, <code>upper_bound</code> to manually iterate the multimap and total the group's contents, but I am hoping there could be better ways already defined in STL ? Can anyone propose a solution as to how I could get the aggregate values for a group in the above example.</p>

"<p>What would you consider ""worst practices"" to follow when developing an embedded system?</p>

<p>Some of my ideas of what not to do are:</p>


<li>Avoid abstracting the hardware layer, instead spreading hardware accesses throughout the code.</li>
<li>Not having any type of emulation environment, having only the actual hardware to exe/cute on.</li>
<li>Avoiding unit tests, perhaps due to the above two points</li>
<li>Not developing the system in a layered structure, so that higher up layers could depend on lower layers functionality debugged and working</li>
<li>Selecting hardware without considering the software & tools that will use it</li>
<li>Using hardware designed for easy debugging, e.g. no test points, no debug LEDs, no JTAG etc.

"<p>I work in C#, and I've been pretty lax about using <code>using</code> blocks to declare objects that implement <code>IDisposable</code>, which you're apparently always supposed to do.  However, I don't see an easy way of knowing when I'm slipping up.  Visual Studio doesn't seem to indicate this in any way (am I just missing something?).  Am I just supposed to check help every time I declare anything, and gradually build up an encyclopedic memory for which objects are and which are not disposable?  Seems unnecessary, painful, and error-prone.</p>

<p>How do <em>you</em> handle this?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>Looking at the related questions sidebar, I found <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2785/setting-objects-to-nullnothing-after-use-in-dot-net"">another question</a> which made it clear that <code>Dispose()</code> is supposed to be called by the object's finalizer anyway.  So even if you never call it yourself, it should eventually happen, meaning you won't have a memory leak if you don't use <code>using</code> (which is what I suppose I was really worried about all along).  The only caveat is that the garbage collector doesn't know how much extra memory is being held by the object as unmanaged stuff, so it won't have an accurate idea how much memory will be freed by collecting the object.  This will result in less-ideal-than-usual performance by the garbage collector.</p>

<p>In short, it's not the end of the world if I miss a <code>using</code>.  I just wish something would generate at least a warning for it.</p>

<p>Ok, fine, stop clamoring.  It's super duper all-fired <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1Y73sPHKxw"">dramatic-chipmunk</a>-level <strong><em>important</em></strong> to call <code>Dispose()</code> or we'll all <em>die</em>.</p>

"<p>How do you properly override <code>isEqual:</code> in Objective-C?  The ""catch"" seems to be that if two objects are equal (as determined by the <code>isEqual:</code> method), they must have the same hash value.</p>

<pre><code>- (BOOL)isEqual:(id)other {
    if (other == self)
        return YES;
    if (!other || ![other isKindOfClass:[self class]])
        return NO;
    return [self isEqualToWidget:other];
}

- (BOOL)isEqualToWidget:(MyWidget *)aWidget {
    if (self == aWidget)
        return YES;
    if (![(id)[self name] isEqual:[aWidget name]])
        return NO;
    if (![[self data] isEqualToData:[aWidget data]])
        return NO;
    return YES;
}
</code></pre>

<p>It checks pointer equality, then class equality, and finally compares the objects using <code>isEqualToWidget:</code>, which only checks  the <code>name</code> and <code>data</code> properties.  What the example <em>doesn't</em> show is how to override <code>hash</code>.</p>

<p>Let's assume there are other properties that do not affect equality, say <code>age</code>.  Shouldn't the <code>hash</code> method be overridden such that only <code>name</code> and <code>data</code> affect the hash?  And if so, how would you do that? Just add the hashes of <code>name</code> and <code>data</code>?  For example:</p>

<pre><code>- (NSUInteger)hash {
    NSUInteger hash = 0;
    hash += [[self name] hash];
    hash += [[self data] hash];
    return hash;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Is that sufficient?  Is there a better technique?  What if you have primitives, like <code>int</code>?  Convert them to <code>NSNumber</code> to get their hash?  Or structs like <code>NSRect</code>?</p>

"<p>How do I take an efficient simple random sample in SQL? The database in question is running MySQL; my table is at least 200,000 rows, and I want a simple random sample of about 10,000.</p>

<p>The ""obvious"" answer is to:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 10000

<p>For large tables, that's too slow: it calls RAND() for every row (which already puts it at O(n)), and sorts them, making it O(n lg n) at best. Is there a way to do this faster than O(n)?</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: As Andrew Mao points out in the comments, If you're using this approach on SQL Server, you should use the T-SQL function NEWID(), because RAND() <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms177610.asp"">may return the same value for all rows</a>.</p>

<p><em>EDIT: 5 YEARS LATER</em></p>

<p>I ran into this problem again with a bigger table, and ended up using a version of @ignorant's solution, with two tweaks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sample the rows to 2-5x my desired sample size, to cheaply ORDER BY RAND()</li>
<li>Save the result of RAND() to an indexed column on every insert/update. (If your data set isn't very update-heavy, you may need to find another way to keep this column fresh.)</li>
</ul>

<p>To take a 1000-item sample of a table, I count the rows and sample the result down to, on average, 10,000 rows with the the frozen_rand column:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table; -- Use this to determine rand_low and rand_high

  SELECT *
    FROM table
   WHERE frozen_rand BETWEEN %(rand_low)s AND %(rand_high)s
ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 1000
</code></pre>

<p>(My actual implementation involves more work to make sure I don't undersample, and to manually wrap rand_high around, but the basic idea is ""randomly cut your N down to a few thousand."")</p>

<p>While this makes some sacrifices, it allows me to sample the database down using an index scan, until it's small enough to ORDER BY RAND() again.</p>

"<p><strong>General Description:</strong></p>

<p>To start with what works, I have a <code>UITableView</code> which has been placed onto an Xcode-generated view using Interface Builder.  The view's File Owner is set to an Xcode-generated subclass of <code>UIViewController</code>.  To this subclass I have added working implementations of <code>numberOfSectionsInTableView: tableView:numberOfRowsInSection:</code> and <code>tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:</code> and the Table View's <code>dataSource</code> and <code>delegate</code> are connected to this class via the File Owner in Interface Builder.</p>

<p>The above configuration works with no problems.  The issue occurs when I want to move this Table View's <code>dataSource</code> and <code>delegate</code>-implementations out to a separate class, most likely because there are other controls on the View besides the Table View and I'd like to move the Table View-related code out to its own class.  To accomplish this, I try the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a new subclass of <code>UITableViewController</code> in Xcode</li></li>
<li>Move the known-good implementations of <code>numberOfSectionsInTableView:</code>, <code>tableView:numberOfRowsInSection:</code> and <code>tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:</code> to the new subclass</li>
<li>Drag a <code>UITableViewController</code> to the top level of the  <em>existing</em> XIB in InterfaceBuilder, delete the <code>UIView</code>/<code>UITableView</code> that are automatically created for this <code>UITableViewController</code>, then set the <code>UITableViewController</code>'s class to match the new subclass</li>
<li>Remove the previously-working <code>UITableView</code>'s existing <code>dataSource</code> and <code>delegate</code> connections and connect them to the new <code>UITableViewController</code></li>
</ul>

<p>When complete, I do not have a working <code>UITableView</code>.  I end up with one of three outcomes which can seemingly happen at random:</p>

<ul>
<li>When the <code>UITableView</code> loads, I get a runtime error indicating I am sending <code>tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:</code> to an object which does not recognize it</li>
<li>When the <code>UITableView</code> loads, the project breaks into the debugger without error</li>
<li>There is no error, but the <code>UITableView</code> does not appear</li>
</ul>

<p>With some debugging and having created a basic project just to reproduce this issue, I am usually seeing the 3rd option above (no error but no visible table view).  I added some NSLog calls and found that although <code>numberOfSectionsInTableView:</code> and <code>numberOfRowsInSection:</code> are both getting called, <code>cellForRowAtIndexPath:</code> is not.  I am convinced I'm missing something really simple and was hoping the answer may be obvious to someone with more experience than I have.  If this doesn't turn out to be an easy answer I would be happy to update with some code or a sample project.  Thanks for your time!</p>

<p><strong>Complete steps to reproduce:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Create a new iPhone OS, View-Based Application in Xcode and call it <code>TableTest</code></li>
<li>Open <code>TableTestViewController.xib</code> in Interface Builder and drag a <code>UITableView</code> onto the provided view surface.</li>
<li>Connect the <code>UITableView</code>'s <code>dataSource</code> and <code>delegate</code>-outlets to File's Owner, which should already represent the <code>TableTestViewController</code>-class.  Save your changes</li>
<li>Back in Xcode, add the following code to <code>TableTestViewController.m:</code></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<pre><code>- (NSInteger)numberOfSectionsInTableView:(UITableView *)tableView {
    NSLog(@""Returning num sections"");
    return 1;
}
- (NSInteger)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView numberOfRowsInSection:(NSInteger)section {
    NSLog(@""Returning num rows"");
    return 1;
}
- (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {
    NSLog(@""Trying to return cell"");
    static NSString *CellIdentifier = @""Cell"";

    UITableViewCell *cell = [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:CellIdentifier];
    if (cell == nil) {
        cell = [[[UITableViewCell alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectZero reuseIdentifier:CellIdentifier] autorelease];
    }
    cell.text = @""Hello"";
    NSLog(@""Returning cell"");
    return cell;
}
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>Build and Go, and you should see the word <code>Hello</code> appear in the <code>UITableView</code></p></li>
<li><p>Now to attempt to move this <code>UITableView</code>'s logic out to a separate class, first create a new file in Xcode, choosing <code>UITableViewController</code> subclass and calling the class <code>TableTestTableViewController</code></p></li>
<li>Remove the above code snippet from <code>TableTestViewController.m</code> and place it into <code>TableTestTableViewController.m</code>, replacing the default implementation of these three methods with ours.</li>
<li>Back in Interface Builder within the same <code>TableTestViewController.xib</code>-file, drag a <code>UITableViewController</code> into the main IB window and delete the new <code>UITableView</code> object that automatically came with it</li>
<li>Set the class for this new <code>UITableViewController</code> to <code>TableTestTableViewController</code></li>
<li>Remove the <code>dataSource</code> and <code>delegate</code> bindings from the existing, previously-working <code>UITableView</code> and reconnect the same two bindings to the new <code>TableTestTableViewController</code> we created.</li>
<li>Save changes, Build and Go, and if you're getting the results I'm getting, note the <code>UITableView</code> no longer functions properly</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
With some more troubleshooting and some assistance from the <a href=""https://devforums.apple.com/message/5453"">iPhone Developer Forums</a>, I've documented a solution!  The main <code>UIViewController</code> subclass of the project needs an outlet pointing to the <code>UITableViewController</code> instance.  To accomplish this, simply add the following to the primary view's header (<code>TableTestViewController.h</code>):</p>

<pre><code>#import ""TableTestTableViewController.h""
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>IBOutlet TableTestTableViewController *myTableViewController;
</code></pre>

<p>Then, in Interface Builder, connect the new outlet from File's Owner to <code>TableTestTableViewController</code> in the main IB window.  No changes are necessary in the UI part of the XIB.  Simply having this outlet in place, even though no user code directly uses it, resolves the problem completely.  Thanks to those who've helped and credit goes to BaldEagle on the iPhone Developer Forums for finding the solution.</p>

"<p>I'm having problems with Iterator.remove() called on a HashSet.</p>

<p>I've a Set of time stamped objects.  Before adding a new item to the Set, I loop through the set, identify an old version of that data object and remove it (before adding the new object).  the timestamp is included in hashCode and equals(), but not equalsData().</p>

<pre><code>for (Iterator&lt;DataResult&gt; i = allResults.iterator(); i.hasNext();)
{
    DataResult oldData = i.next();
    if (data.equalsData(oldData))
    {   
        i.remove();
        break;
    }
}
allResults.add(data)
</code></pre>

<p>The odd thing is that i.remove() silently fails (no exception) for some of the items in the set.  I've verified</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The line i.remove() is actually called.  I can call it from the debugger directly at the breakpoint in Eclipse and it still fails to change the state of Set</p></li>
<li><p>DataResult is an immutable object so it can't have changed after being added to the set originally.</p></li>
<li><p>The equals and hashCode() methods use @Override to ensure they are the correct methods.  Unit tests verify these work.  </p></li>
<li><p>This also fails if I just use a for statement and Set.remove instead.  (e.g. loop through the items, find the item in the list, then call Set.remove(oldData) after the loop).</p></li>
<li><p>I've tested in JDK 5 and JDK 6.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I thought I must be missing something basic, but after spending some significant time on this my colleague and I are stumped.  Any suggestions for things to check?</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>There have been questions - is DataResult truly immutable.  Yes.  There are no setters.  And when the Date object is retrieved (which is a mutable object), it is done by creating a copy.</p>

<pre><code>public Date getEntryTime()
{
    return DateUtil.copyDate(entryTime);
}

public static Date copyDate(Date date)
{
    return (date == null) ? null : new Date(date.getTime());
}
</code></pre>

<p>FURTHER EDIT (some time later):
For the record -- DataResult was not immutable!  It referenced an object which had a hashcode which changed when persisted to the database (bad practice, I know).  It turned out that if a DataResult was created with a transient subobject, and the subobject was persisted, the DataResult hashcode was changed.</p>

<p>Very subtle -- I looked at this many times and didn't notice the lack of immutability.</p>

"<p>I'm working on a project which stores single images and text files in one place, like a time capsule. Now, most every project can be saved as one file, like DOC, PPT, and ODF.

<ul>
<li><p>Microsoft has <b><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHTML"">MHTML</a></b> -- basically a file encoded exactly as a MIME HTML email message. It's already based on an existing standard, and MHTML as its own was proposed as <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2557"">rfc2557</a>. This is a great idea and it's been around forever, except it's been a ""proposed standard"" since 1999. Plus, implementations other than IE's are just cumbersome. IE and Opera support it; Firefox and Safari with a cumbersome extension.</p></li>
<li><p>Mozilla has <b><a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/212"">Mozilla Archive Format</a></b> -- basically a ZIP file with the markup and images, with metadata saved as RDF. It's an awesome idea -- Winamp does this for skins, and ODF and OOXML for their embedded images. I love this, except, 1. Nobody else except Mozilla uses it, 2. The only extension supporting it wasn't updated since Firefox 1.5.</p></li>
<li><p><b><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme"">Data URIs</a></b> are becoming more popular. Instead of referencing an external location a la MHTML or MAF, you encode the file straight into the HTML markup as base64. Depending on your view, it's streamlined since the files are <em>right</em> where the markup is. However, support is still somewhat weak. Firefox, Opera, and Safari support it without gaffes; IE, the <em>market leader</em>, only started supporting it at IE8, and even then with limits. </p></li>
<li><p>Then of course, there's <b>""Save complete webpage""</b> where the HTML markup is saved as <code>""savedpage.html""</code> and the files in a separate <code>""savedpage_files""</code> folder. Afaik, everyone does this. It's well supported. But having to handle two separate elements is not simple and streamlined at <em>all</em>. My project needs to have them in a <em>single archive</em>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As I understand it, an interface only describes behaviour, and serves the purpose of describing a contractual obligation for classes implementing the interface that certain behaviour is implemented.</p>

"<p>I was wondering about the best practices for indicating invalid argument combinations in Python. I've come across a few situations where you have a function like so:</p>

    :param name: Name of some external entity to import.
    :param save: Save the ORM object before returning.
    :param recurse: Attempt to import associated objects as well. Because you
        need the original object to have a key to relate to, save must be
        `True` for recurse to be `True`.
    :raise BadValueError: If `recurse and not save`.
    :return: The ORM object.

<p>The only annoyance with this is that every package has its own, usually slightly differing <code>BadValueError</code>.

"<p>This is kind of a beginners question, but I haven't done C++ in a long time, so here goes...</p>

<p>I have a class that contains a dynamically allocated array, say</p>

<pre><code>class A
{
    int* myArray;
    A()
    {
        myArray = 0;
    }
    A(int size)
    {
        myArray = new int[size];
    }
    ~A()
    {
        // Note that as per MikeB's helpful style critique, no need to check against 0.
        delete [] myArray;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But now I want to create a dynamically allocated array of these classes. Here's my current code:</p>

<pre><code>A* arrayOfAs = new A[5];
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; ++i)
{
    arrayOfAs[i] = A(3);
}
</code></pre>

<p>But this blows up terribly. Because the new <code>A</code> object created (with the <code>A(3)</code> call) gets destructed when the <code>for</code> loop iteration finishes, and this means that the internal <code>myArray</code> of that <code>A</code> instance gets <code>delete []</code>-ed.</p>

<p>So I think my syntax must be terribly wrong? I guess there are a few fixes that seem like overkill, which I'm hoping to avoid:</p>

<ul>
<li>Creating a copy constructor for <code>A</code>.</li>
<li>Using <code>vector&lt;int&gt;</code> and <code>vector&lt;A&gt;</code> so I don't have to worry about all this.</li>
<li>Instead of having <code>arrayOfAs</code> be an array of <code>A</code> objects, have it be an array of <code>A*</code> pointers.</li>
</ul>

<p>I would think this is just some beginners thing where there's a syntax that actually works when attempting to dynamically allocate an array of things that have internal dynamic allocation.</p>

<p>(Also, style critiques appreciated, since it's been a while since I did C++.)</p>

<p><strong>Update for future viewers</strong>: All of the answers below are really helpful. Martin's is accepted because of the example code and the useful ""rule of 4,"" but I really suggest reading them all. Some are good, succinct statements of what's wrong, and some point out correctly how and why <code>vector</code>s are a good way to go.</p>

"<p>We've been fighting with <a href=""http://haproxy.1wt.eu/"" rel=""nofollow"">HAProxy</a> for a few days now in Amazon EC2; the experience has so far been great, but we're stuck on squeezing more performance out of the software load balancer. We're not exactly Linux networking whizzes (we're a .NET shop, normally), but we've so far held our own, attempting to set proper ulimits, inspecting kernel messages and tcpdumps for any irregularities.
So far though, we've reached a plateau of about 1,700 requests/sec, at which point client timeouts abound (we've been using and tweaking <a href=""http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/httperf/"" rel=""nofollow"">httperf</a> for this purpose). A coworker and I were listening to the most recent Stack Overflow podcast, in which the Reddit founders note that their entire site runs off one HAProxy node, and that it so far hasn't become a bottleneck. Ack! Either there's somehow not seeing that many concurrent requests, we're doing something horribly wrong, or the shared nature of EC2 is limiting the network stack of the Ec2 instance (we're using a large instance type). Considering the fact that both Joel and the Reddit founders agree that network will likely be the limiting factor, is it possible that's the limitation we're seeing? </p>

<p>Any thoughts are greatly appreciated!</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> It looks like the actual issue was not, in fact, with the load balancer node! The culprit was actually the nodes running httperf, in this instance. As httperf builds and tears down a socket for each request, it spends a good amount of CPU time in the kernel. As we bumped the request rate higher, the TCP FIN TTL (being 60s by default) was keeping sockets around too long, and the ip_local_port_range's default was too low for this usage scenario. Basically, after a few minutes of the client (httperf) node constantly creating and destroying new sockets, the number of unused ports ran out, and subsequent 'requests' errored-out at this stage, yielding low request/sec numbers and a large amount of errors. </p>

<p>We also had looked at nginx, but We've been working with RighScale, and they've got drop-in scripts for HAProxy. Oh, and we've got too tight a deadline [of course] to switch out components unless it proves absolutely necessary. Mercifully, being on AWS allows us to test out another setup using nginx in parallel (if warranted), and make the switch overnight later on.</p>

"<p>I know how to create an array of structs but with a predefined size. However is there a way to create a dynamic array of structs such that the array could get bigger?</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>    typedef struct
    {
        char *str;
    } words;

    main()
    {
        words x[100]; // I do not want to use this, I want to dynamic increase the size of the array as data comes in.
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Is this possible?</p>

<hr>

<p>I've researched this: <code>words* array = (words*)malloc(sizeof(words) * 100);</code></p>

<p>I don't think I explained myself clearly, my apologies.</p>

<p>I want to get rid of the 100 and store the data as it comes in. Thus if 76 fields of data comes in, I want to store 76 and not 100. I'm assuming that I don't know how much data is coming into my program. In the struct I defined above I could create the first ""index"" as:</p>

<pre><code>    words* array = (words*)malloc(sizeof(words));
</code></pre>

<p>However I want to dynamically add elements to the array after. I hope I described the problem area clearly enough. The major challenge is to dynamically add a second field, at least that is the challenge for the moment.</p>

<hr>

<p>I've made a little progress however:</p>

<pre><code>    typedef struct {
        char *str;
    } words;

    // Allocate first string.
    words x = (words) malloc(sizeof(words));
    x[0].str = ""john"";

    // Allocate second string.
    x=(words*) realloc(x, sizeof(words));
    x[1].FirstName = ""bob"";

    // printf second string.
    printf(""%s"", x[1].str); --&gt; This is working, it's printing out bob.

    free(x); // Free up memory.

    printf(""%s"", x[1].str); --&gt; Not working since its still printing out BOB even though I freed up memory. What is wrong?
</code></pre>

<p>I did some error checking and this is what I found. If after I free up memory for x I add the following:</p>

<pre><code>    x=NULL;
</code></pre>

<p>then if I try to print x I get an error which is what I want. So is it that the free function is not working, at least on my compiler? I'm using DevC??</p>

<hr>

<p>Thanks, I understand now due to:</p>

<p>FirstName is a pointer to an array of char which is not being allocated by the malloc, only the pointer is being allocated and after you call free, it doesn't erase the memory, it just marks it as available on the heap to be over written later. – MattSmith</p>

"<p>I am trying to come up with the best data structure for use in a high throughput C++ server. The data structure will be used to store anything from a few to several million objects, and no sorting is required (though a unique sort key can be provided very cheaply).</p>

<p>The requirements are that it can support efficient insert, ideally O(1), moderately efficient removal, and efficient traversal.  It doesn't need to support a find operation (other than might be needed for removal).</p>

<p>The twist is that it must be thread safe with respect to modifications while other threads are enumerating the data structure.  This means that a simple red-black tree doesn't work, since one thread can't insert an element (and perform the necessary tree rotations) without messing up any cursors held by other threads.</p>

<p>It is <strong>not</strong> acceptable to use a read/write lock and defer the write operations until all readers have finished, since read operations may be long lived.  It doesn't matter if inserts that happen while there is a reader are visible to that reader or not.</p>

<p>Memory footprint is also very important, and small is obviously better!</p>

<p>What suggestions are there?</p>

<p><strong>Response to comments:</strong></p>

<p>Thanks for the answers.</p>

<p>No, inserts cannot invalidate existing iterators.  Iterators may or may not see the new insert, but they must see everything that they would have seen if the insert hadn't occurred.</p>

<p>Deletion is required, however due to higher level rules I can guarantee that a iterator will never be stopped on an item that is available for deletion.</p>

<p>Locking per node for a cursor would have too great an impact on performance.  There may be a number of threads reading at once, and any kind of memory hot spot that multiple threads are using in a lock kills memory bandwidth (as we discovered the hard way!).  Even a simple count of readers with multiple threads calling InterlockedIncrement fails to scale cleanly.  </p>

<p>I agree a linked list is likely the best approach.  Deletes are rare, so paying the memory penalty for the back pointers to support O(1) delete is costly and we may compute those separately on demand and since deletes tend to be batch operations.</p>

<p>Fortunately insertion into a linked list doesn't require any locking for readers, as long as the pointers are updated in the inserted node before the head pointer is changed.</p>

<p>The lock-copy-unlock idea is interesting.  The amount of data involved is too large for this to work as the default for readers, but it could be used for writers when they collide with readers.  A read/write lock would protect the whole structure, and the write would clone the data structure if it collides with a reader.  Writes are much rarer than reads.</p>

"<h2>Question</h2>

<p>I'm sure many of you have been faced by the challenge of localizing a database backend to an application. If you've not then I'd be pretty confident in saying that the odds of you having to do so in the future is quite large. I'm talking anout storing multiple translations of texts (and the same can be said for currency etc.) for your database entities.</p>

<p>For example the classic ""Category"" table might have a Name and a Description column which should be globalized. One way would be to do have a ""Text"" table for each of your entities and then do a join to retreive the values based on the provided language.</p>

<p>This leaves you with a lot of ""Text"" tables, one for each entity which you want to localize, with the addition of a TextType to distinguish between the various texts that it may store.</p>

<p>I'm curious if there are any, documented, best-practises / design patterns on implementing this kind of support into a SQL Server 2005/2008 datebase (I'm being specific about the RDBMS since it might contain supported keywords and such which helps with the implementation)?</p>

<h2>Thoughts on XML approach</h2>

<p>One idea I have been toying with (albeit only in my head so far) was to leverage the XML datatype introduced in SQL Server 2005. The idea was to make columns which should support localization, of the XML datatype (and bind a schema to it). The XML would contain the localized strings along with the language code / culture it was tied to.</p>

<p>Something along the lines of</p>

<pre><code>Product
ID (int, identity)
Name (XML ...)
Description (XML ...)
</code></pre>

<p>Then you would have something like this as the XML</p>

<pre><code>&lt;localization&gt;
  &lt;text culture=""sv-SE""&gt;Detta är ett namn&lt;/text&gt;
  &lt;text culture=""en-EN""&gt;This is a name&lt;/text&gt;
&lt;/localization&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You could then do (This isn't production code so I'll use the *)</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
From Product
Where Product.ID = 10
</code></pre>

<p>And you would get back the product with all localized texts which would mean you would have to do the extraction on the client-side. The biggest problem here is obviously the amount of extra data that you would have to return on each query, The benefits would be a cleaner design with no look-up tables, joins and so on. </p>

<p>Btw, what ever method I do end up using in my design I will still be using Linq To SQL (.NET Platform) to query the database (the XML approach should be a problem since it would return an XElement which could be interpreted client-side)</p>

<p>So suggestion on database localization design patterns, and possibly comments on the XML thought, would be very apprechiated.</p>

<p>My question is: How do I use preventDefault() to stop the link acting as a link and adding # to the end of my URL &amp; jumping to the top of the page? I can't figure out the right syntax, I just keep getting an error saying that preventDefault() is not a function.</p>

"<p>I want to be able to get a list of all differences between two JavaScript object graphs, with the property names and values where the deltas occur. </p>

<p>For what it is worth, these objects are usually retrieved from the server as JSON and typically are no more than a handful of layers deep (i.e. it may be an array of objects that themselves have data and then arrays with other data objects).</p>

<p>I want to not only see the changes to basic properties, but differences in the number of members of an array, etc. etc.</p>

<p>If I don't get an answer, I will probably end up writing this myself, but hope someone has already done this work or know of someone who has.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>EDIT: These objects will typically be very close in structure to one another, so we are not talking about objects that are utterly different from one another, but may have 3 or 4 deltas.</p>

"<p>It's been a while since I last coded arm assembler and I'm a little rusty on the details. If I call a C function from arm,  I only have to worry about saving r0-r3 and lr, right? If the C function uses any other registers, is it responsible for saving those on the stack and restoring them? In other words, the compiler would generate code to do this for C functions.  For example if I use r10 in an assembler function, I don't have to push its value on the stack, or to memory, and pop/restore it after a C call, do I?</p>

"<p>I'm working on a program that processes many requests, none of them reaching more than 50% of CPU (<strong>currently I'm working on a dual core</strong>). So I created a thread for each request, the whole process is faster. Processing 9 requests, a single thread lasts 02min08s, while with 3 threads working simultaneously the time decreased to 01min37s, but it keeps not using 100% CPU, only around 50%.</p>

<p>How could I allow my program to use full processors capability?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
The application isn't IO or Memory bounded, they're at reasonable levels all the time.</p>

<p>I think it has something to do with the 'dual core' thing.</p>

<p>There is a locked method invocation that every request uses, but it is really fast, I don't think this is the problem.</p>

<p>The more cpu-costly part of my code is the call of a dll via COM (the same external method is called from all threads). This dll is also no Memory or IO-bounded, it is an AI recognition component, I'm doing an OCR recognition of paychecks, a paycheck for request.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT2</strong></p>

<p>It is very probable that the STA COM Method is my problem, I contacted the component owners in order to solve this problem.</p>
