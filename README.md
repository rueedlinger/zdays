## Text Mining - How to extract insights from text
To play around with Python use a Python Distribution
- Anaconda, Canopy, ... (https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDistributions)
- Manage dependencies with virtualenv (https://virtualenv.pypa.io/)
- first choice should be the Python Distribution package manager (e.g. conda) and then pip

A Data Pipeline is a uniÔ¨Åed system for capturing events for analysis and building products. 

### Data Pipeline steps
- data extraction - extract text from the different file format. (eg. use [tika python](https://github.com/chrismattmann/tika-python))
- [transform](unstructured_data.ipynb) - Transforming unstructured data into structured data.
